Colloidal silica and ceria based slurries, both using $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ as an oxidizer, for chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of Si-face ( 0001 ) 6H-SiC substrate, were investigated to obtain higher material removal rate (MRR) and ultra-smooth surface. The results indicate that there was a significant difference in the CMP performance of 6H-SiC between silica and ceria based slurries. For the ceria based slurries, a higher MRR was obtained, especially in strong acid $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ environment, and the maximum MRR $(1089 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{h})$ and a smoother surface with an average roughness Ra of 0.11 nm was achieved using slurries containing $2 \mathrm{wt} \%$ colloidal ceria, 0.05 M KMnO 4 at pH 2 . In contrast, due to the attraction between negative charged silica particles and positive charged SiC surface below pH 5 , the maximum MRR of silica based slurry was only $185 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{h}$ with surface roughness Ra of 0.254 nm using slurries containing $6 \mathrm{wt} \%$ colloidal silica, 0.05 M $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ at pH 6 . The polishing mechanism was discussed based on the zeta potential measurements of the abrasives and the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the polished SiC surfaces.

## 1. Introduction

Due to its outstanding properties, such as wide band gap, good thermal conductivity, high heat resistance, high temperature stability and good crystal lattice arrangement with GaN, silicon carbide (SiC) has become a promising semiconductor material for high power and high frequency electric applications [1-3]. Many of these applications require a flat and defect-free SiC substrate surface; however, it is difficult to obtain high removal rates because of its high mechanical hardness and strong chemical inertness [4].

Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is one of the most effective ways to produce ultra-smooth undamaged surfaces in semiconductor industry. Currently, several researchers have studied the CMP of SiC single crystal substrates using colloidal silica with different chemicals [5-8]. The material removal rate (MRR) and surface quality varied greatly with the different crystal face orientations during the CMP of 6H-SiC single crystal substrates and a maximum in material removal rate (MRR) was measured for the Si-face of $153 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{h}$ with an average RMS roughness of 0.096 nm using colloidal silica in KOH solution [5]. A mixed abrasive slurry containing colloidal silica and nano-diamond at high pH value was used in the CMP of 6H-SiC substrates and the MRR and Ra were

153 nm/h and 0.27 nm , respectively [7]. Fe nanoparticles, as well as $\mathrm{Pt} / \mathrm{C}$ nanoparticles were used as a catalyst added into the colloidal silica based slurry, and the MRR of $120 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{h}$ and Ra of 0.05 nm were achieved for Si-face $4 \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{SiC}$ wafer [8]. However, the MRR of these experiments were not high enough for industry applications. In order to shorten the CMP process, it is necessary to investigate a highly efficient CMP slurry for SiC single crystal substrates.

A CMP process could be significantly influenced by many factors, such as abrasives, pH value, oxidants, etc. Among the various oxidants, $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ is a strong oxidizer and it can etch the SiC without friction [9]. Furthermore, ceria abrasives have been reported to have high chemical reactivity and can increase removal rate in Silica polishing [10]. However, little effort has been made to investigate the slurries containing potassium permanganate with silica or ceria for CMP of SiC substrates. In this paper, the CMP performance of Si-face ( 0001 ) 6H-SiC single crystal substrates were compared between silica and ceria based slurries, both using $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ as an oxidizer. The zeta potentials of silica and ceria particles in the presence of KMnO 4 were investigated and the chemical composition of the polished surfaces was studied using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The polishing mechanism of the SiC substrates was also discussed.

## 2. Materials and experimental methods

N-type, 2-inch diameter Si-face ( 0001 ) 6H-SiC single crystal wafers (TanKeBlue Semiconductor Co. Ltd, Beijing, China) were

used in the polishing experiments. Silica abrasives (Nexsil 85A, mean diameter of $50 \mathrm{~nm}, 30 \mathrm{wt} \%$ acid-stabilized colloidal aqueous, Nyacol Nano Technologies) and ceria abrasives (Tizox 9872, mean diameter of $140 \mathrm{~nm}, 50 \mathrm{wt} \%$ colloidal aqueous, Ferro Corp.) were diluted to use at different particle concentration. The chemical additives, potassium permanganate $\left(\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}, \geq 99 \%\right)$, nitric acid (aq. $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}, 70 \%$ ), and potassium hydroxide ( $\mathrm{KOH}, \geq 85 \%$ ) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Corporation and used without further purification.

The slurries were prepared by dissolving the chemical additives in deionized water followed by adding abrasives to this solution, then stirred using a magnetic stirrer for about 10 min . The effect of pH value, abrasive and $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ concentration on the MRR of 6H-SiC were investigated through orthogonal test in our previous work. The results show that the pH valve is the most important factor. Therefore, in this paper, the concentration of silica particles, ceria particles and $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ were kept at $6 \mathrm{wt} \%, 2 \mathrm{wt} \%$ and 0.05 M , respectively.

The CMP experiment was performed on CETR CP-4 polisher using a polyurethane IC-1000 K-Groove pad supplied by Dow Electronic Materials (Newark, DE). The polishing pad was conditioned (ex situ) by a 4-inch diamond grit conditioner (3M, Inc.). Each CMP experiment was done for a duration of 20 min at 4 psi down pressure with the slurry flow rate of $90 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ and the platen/carrier speed of $90 / 90 \mathrm{rpm}$ (Table 1). All the 6 H -SiC wafers were prepolished with slurries only containing $6 \mathrm{wt} \%$ colloidal silica at pH 8 and each CMP experiment was repeated three times.

The MRR was calculated by measuring the weight loss of the wafer before and after polishing using an electronic balance with the accuracy 0.01 mg (Mettler Toledo AG 285) and expressed in $\mathrm{nm} / \mathrm{h}$. The surface morphology of the wafer was measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM). The zeta potentials of silica and ceria particles in the presence of $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ at different pH values (adjusted with KOH or $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ ) were determined at room temperature using a zeta plus particle apparatus (Nano-ZS, Malvern). XPS experiments were carried out on a RBD upgraded PHI-5000C ESCA system (PerkinElmer) with Mg Kı radiation ( $h_{\nu}=1253.6 \mathrm{eV}$ ) or Al Kı radiation ( $h_{\nu}=1486.6 \mathrm{eV}$ ). The X-ray anode was run at 250 W , the high voltage was kept at 14.0 kV with a detection angle at $54^{\circ}$ and the base pressure of the analyzer chamber was around $5 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~Pa}$.

## 3. Results and discussion

### 3.1. CMP of Si-face 6H-SiC

Fig. 1 shows the effect of pH value ranging from 4 to 10 on the MRR of 6H-SiC using silica based slurries. The MRR increased with the increase of pH value in the beginning. After it reached the maximum of $185 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{h}$ at pH 6 , then MRR decreased with the increase of pH value. While the MRR decreased sharply with the increase of pH value ranging from 2 to 8 in ceria based slurries, as shown in Fig. 2. The maximum of MRR was $1089 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{h}$ at pH 2 .

Fig. 2. The effect of pH value on the MRR of 6H-SiC with ceria based slurries.

Fig. 3 shows the surface morphology of 6H-SiC polished by the silica based slurry at pH 6 . It can be seen that the post-polished surface of Si-face 6H-SiC was excellent with an average roughness Ra of 0.25 nm . A smoother surface with an average roughness Ra of 0.11 nm can be achieved using the ceria based slurry at pH 2 , as shown in Fig. 4. The better surface quality may be due to the fact that the mohs' hardness of ceria is lower than that of silica.

### 3.2. Zeta potential of ceria and silica particles

The electrostatic interactions between abrasive particles and wafer surface are the cause for the particle adhesion to the wafer surface, this may cause particle contamination of the wafer surface and reduce the contact area between the wafer surface and oxidant, suppressing the material removal in the CMP of SiC. In order to study these electrostatic interactions in our CMP process, the zeta potentials of silica and ceria particles in the presence of $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ were investigated in the pH range from 2 to 10 . Both the zeta potentials of silica and ceria particles decreased with the increasing of pH values, as shown in Fig. 5. Silica particles were negatively charged in the entire pH range, while ceria particles were positive charged over the pH range of $2-8$ and its isoelectric point was around pH 8 , similar to the results reported by Veera Dantu et al. [11].

The iso-electric point (IEP) of SiC in DI water is about 5 [12]. Therefore, positive charged SiC surface was expected to be repelled by ceria particles for the pH values from 2 to 5 and be attracted from 5 to 8 . In contrast, negative charged silica particles were expected

to be attracted by positive charged SiC surface below pH 5 , which might reduce the oxidation area of the SiC surface.

### 3.3. XPS analysis of 6H-SiC polished surfaces

Peaks corresponding to the C 1 s , O 1 s , Si 2 s and Si 2 p photoelectrons are clearly seen in the XPS survey scan spectra of the polished 6H-SiC surfaces, as shown in Fig. 6. The spectra of the polished surface were similar except for a shorter O 1 s peak in the presence of $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$.

Table 2 shows the atomic compositions (\%) of the 6H-SiC surfaces polished with different slurries. From the data illustrated in Table 2, it can be seen that the surface concentration of oxygen in the pre-polished 6H-SiC surfaces could be reduced in the CMP process using slurries containing $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$. And the $\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{Si}$ ratio was higher in the polished SiC surfaces than in the pre-polished SiC surfaces, especially when ceria particles were used, indicating that Si was removed faster than C during the CMP process. Furthermore, the

C/Si ratio of the polished surfaces was significantly higher than the normal stoichiometric value of 1 .

Fig. 7 demonstrates the Si 2 p and C 1 s spectra of the Si-face 6HSiC surfaces polished with different slurries. There were three main peaks due to $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}(100.4 \mathrm{eV}), \mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}(101.1 \mathrm{eV})$ and $\mathrm{SiO}_{x} \mathrm{C}_{y}(101.9)$ on the Si-face 6H-SiC surfaces polished with different slurries, as shown in Si 2p curve-fitting result of Fig. 7(a, c, e) [13], [14]. The chemical state of carbon atoms was also analyzed using C 1 s spectra of the Si-face 6H-SiC surfaces polished with different slurries, as shown in

Fig. 7(b, d, f). Six peaks near $282.4 \mathrm{eV}, 283.2 \mathrm{eV}, 284.6 \mathrm{eV}, 285.1 \mathrm{eV}$, $286.1 \mathrm{eV}, 288 \mathrm{eV}$, corresponding to C 1 s of $\mathrm{SiC}, \mathrm{Si}_{4} \mathrm{C}_{4-x} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$, $\mathrm{Si}_{4} \mathrm{C}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{4}, \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ binding energy, respectively [15], [16], were observed in C 1 S curve-fitting results. The peaks of $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ were generally detected in C 1 s spectra, resulted from the contamination of the carbon in ambient or adhesive component of the polishing surface [17], leading to the unmoral of the C/Si ratio on the SiC surface demonstrated in Table 2. As can be seen in Fig. 7, the concentrations of the oxidized species, such as $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}, \mathrm{SiO}_{x} \mathrm{C}_{y}, \mathrm{Si}_{4} \mathrm{C}_{4-x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, $\mathrm{Si}_{4} \mathrm{C}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{4}, \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$, were significantly higher in the SiC surfaces
polished with slurries containing $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ than in the pre-polished SiC surface. The peak near 100.4 eV and 282.4 eV , corresponding to Si 2 p and C 1 s of SiC binding energy, respectively, decreased dramatically in the 6 H -SiC surface polished with slurries containing $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$, especially at pH 2 .

The relative proportions of the chemical components on the SiC surfaces are listed in Table 3. From the data revealed in Table 3, it can be seen clearly that the relative atomic concentration of $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}$ in Si 2 p spectra was lower in the SiC surfaces polished with slurries containing $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ than in the pre-polished SiC surface. The proportion

of oxidized species of $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}$, such as $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{SiO}_{x} \mathrm{C}_{y}$, increased in the SiC surfaces polished with slurries containing KMnO 4 , indicating that the oxidation happened on the SiC surfaces. Furthermore, a similar result can be found in C 1 s spectra of 6 H -SiC surface. However, the silicon-free carbonaceous species, such as $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$, which are not bonded to any silicon atom and hard to remove from the surface [18], was lower in the SiC surface polished by ceriabased slurry at pH 2 than by silica-based slurry at pH 6 .

### 3.4. Polishing mechanism

There are two key steps involved in the SiC CMP removal mechanism: an oxide layer is formed on the surface of SiC substrates by oxidation and then removed by mechanical abrasion.

In the CMP process, atoms on the SiC surface were oxidized by $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ (as shown in Table 3) and the oxidized species of $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}$ (e.g. $\mathrm{Si}_{x} \mathrm{C}_{y} \mathrm{O}_{z}$ or $\mathrm{SiO}_{x} \mathrm{C}_{y}$ ) could be further oxidized or hydrolyzed to form carbon-free silicon oxide species [18], then removed by mechanical abrasion.

The oxidizing strength of $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ decreases with the increase of pH value. In the acidic pH range, $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ acts as a strong oxidizer and can be reduced to $\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ via the following reaction:
$\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}+8 \mathrm{H}^{+}+5 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Mn}^{2+}+4 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
While in the near neutral pH region, $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ can be reduced to $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ via the following reaction:
$\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}+2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+3 \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{MnO}_{2}+40 \mathrm{H}^{-}$
And in the alkaline pH range, $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ can be reduced to $\mathrm{MnO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$ via the following reaction:
$\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}+\mathrm{e}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{MnO}_{4}{ }^{2-}$
Based on the XPS analysis and the properties of $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$, it can be seen that the increase of the atomic compositions of the oxidized species of $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}$ (e.g. $\mathrm{Si}_{x} \mathrm{C}_{y} \mathrm{O}_{z}$ or $\mathrm{SiO}_{x} \mathrm{C}_{y}$ ) and the decrease of siliconfree carbonaceous species (e.g. $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ ) may be attributed to the strong oxidizing ability of $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ in low pH values. In other words, the silicon-free carbonaceous species may be further oxidized to organic acid, carbon oxide or carbon dioxide in strong acid aq. $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$.

However, negative charged silica particles can be attracted by positive charged SiC surface below pH 5 (as shown in Fig. 5), inhibiting the material removal in the CMP of SiC.

In addition, ceria particles are reported to have a chemical tooth property. During the CMP of $\mathrm{SiC}, \mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Ce}$ bonds can be formed between ceria particles and the oxide layer, then removed rapidly by the mechanical abrasion force [19]. Due to the physical and chemical reaction of the ceria, a higher MRR of the SiC CMP is obtained, especially in strong acid $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ environment.

## 4. Conclusions

In this paper, the CMP performance of Si-face ( 0001 ) 6H-SiC substrates were compared between silica and ceria based slurries, both using $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ as an oxidizer. The maximum MRR ( $1089 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{h}$ ) and a smoother surface with an average roughness Ra of 0.11 nm was achieved using slurries containing $2 \mathrm{wt} \%$ colloidal ceria, 0.05 M $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ at pH 2 . In contrast, the maximum MRR of silica based slurry was only $185 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{h}$ with surface roughness Ra of 0.254 nm using slurries containing $6 \mathrm{wt} \%$ colloidal silica, $0.05 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ at pH 6 . On the basis of zeta potential measurements, silica particles were negatively charged in the entire pH range from 2 to 10 , resulting in the attraction between negative charged silica particles and positive charged SiC surface below pH 5 . While ceria particles were positive charged over the pH range of 2-8. XPS analysis of the polished SiC surface showed that the C/Si ratio was higher in the polished SiC surfaces than in the pre-polished SiC surfaces, especially when ceria particles were used at pH 2 , indicating that Si was removed faster than C during the CMP process.
