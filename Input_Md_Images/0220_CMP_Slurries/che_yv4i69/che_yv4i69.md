Porous ceria $\left(\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}\right)$, Zr-doped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}\right)$, and Gd-doped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}\right)$ abrasives for both surface quality and removal rate improvements were developed using a facile one-pot solvothermal approach. The resulting products were characterized via XRD, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, Raman spectroscopy, UV-visible spectroscopy, and $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ adsorption-desorption measurements. Raman spectra revealed that oxygen vacancies were the dominant defects in $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ nanospheres. $\mathrm{Zr}-$ and Gd -doping treatments contributed to oxygen vacancy enrichment, thus leading to an increased content of trivalent cerium $\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right)$ formed on the $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ surfaces. Oxide-CMP capability of pure $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ abrasives were compared in terms of surface morphology/ roughness/defect, topographical variation, as well as material removal rate (MRR). Atomic force microscopy and interferometric microscopy investigations showed that both $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ abrasives achieved high-quality surfaces with ultra-low roughness ( $0.11-0.14 \mathrm{~nm} \mathrm{Ra}, 0.13-0.17 \mathrm{~nm}$ RMS). As expected, the MRR was accelerated by $78.7 \%$ in alkaline slurries containing $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ abrasives compared to the undoped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$. The improved CMP performance might be attributed to the reduced modulus, the expend pore size, as well as the enriched $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy. Furthermore, the interfacial action and removal mechanism of the $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ abrasives were discussed on the basis of their structure feature and surface chemistry.

## 1. Introduction

Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) [1-5] is one of the most effective and available techniques for surface global planarization, which has been widely applied in the manufacturing of integrated circuits (IC), micro-electromechanical system, hard disk, ceramic, metal, etc. It is generally believed that a typical CMP process involves and combines chemical surface corrosion and mechanical (or tribochemical) material removal. The purpose of CMP is to eliminate the mechanical damages originated from earlier grinding and/or polishing processes and to create ultra-smooth surfaces. CMP performance is mainly affected by the morphological, structural, and physicochemical properties of abrasives.

In a typical CMP process, particle abrasives in polishing slurries are the primary participants in mechanical energy transmission and chemical surface modification. Typically, $100-300 \mathrm{~nm}$ abrasive NPs are available in various CMP applications. The useful properties and
successful applications of abrasive systems are a consequence of the physical and structural characteristics of these nanoparticles (NPs), and their mechanical property and surface chemistry. Theoretical analyses and experimental investigations reveal that porous abrasives [6-15] contribute to the improvements of both surface quality and/or removal efficiency in polishing and grinding processes. It may be attributed to their relative-high elastic responses (or relative-low elastic moduli) under an applied down force, and thus resulting in a reduced contact stress and an enlarged contact area between the abrasive and the surface. The optimized interfacial contact behavior may be responsible for the improved polishing or grinding performances. Up to now, available investigations on porous abrasives mainly focus on (polymer-modified or copper-incorporated) $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ [6-8], $\mathrm{Fe}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} / \mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ [9], cubic boron nitride (CBN) [10], diamond [11], and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ [12-15] materials. Among these porous abrasives, porous $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{pSiO}_{2}\right)$ particles have the advantages of simple synthesis, good sphericity, uniform morphology, narrow particle size-distribution, controlled particle size, as well as tunable pore

diameter and pore structure.
In our previous work [12], the $\mathrm{pSiO}_{2}$ (200-500 nm) spheres with radially oriented channels ( $2-3 \mathrm{~nm}$ of average pore size) were prepared via a modified St√∂ber approach in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a template agent. Oxide-CMP results showed that the $\mathrm{pSiO}_{2}$ abrasives contributed to removal rate enhancement as well as surface roughness and topographical variation reductions, compared to the non-porous $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ ones. As reported by Ryu and coworkers [13], the wrinkled $\mathrm{pSiO}_{2}$ NPs with uniform sizes of 65-400 nm were also developed by applying a cooling stage to the reaction mixture, and proposed as novel abrasives for improved oxide-CMP performance. In our subsequent work [14], the $\mathrm{pSiO}_{2}$ spheres (ca. 80 nm ) with dendritic-like structures and controlled average pore size (3-6 nm ) were fabricated via an oil-water biphase stratification method. It was also revealed that decreased $\mathrm{pSiO}_{2}$ particle sizes and/or expanded pore sizes contributed to surface quality and polishing efficiency increasements, possibly resulting from the enlarged real contact area, promoted tribo-chemical wear, and enhanced adhesion action. These provided data were accordance with the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as described in literature [16]. And it was further suggested that the contact-area-based mechanism and contact-penetration-adhesion model might be predominant during CMP processes. Recently, Gao and coworkers [15] reported the synthesis of rod-shaped $\mathrm{pSiO}_{2}$ abrasives for improved surface quality of cadmium zinc telluride wafers. It is commonly recognized that the superior CMP performance may result from the low modulus and elastic deformability of $\mathrm{pSiO}_{2}$ abrasives under an applied force. In spite of the several reports on $\mathrm{pSiO}_{2}$ abrasive NPs, little is known about the CMP applications of porous $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}\right)$ abrasives.

In CMP applications, the type, size and distribution, structure, and shape of particle abrasives play a key role in determining the surface morphology, roughness, defect and damage, as well as the material removal efficiency. Among the commonly used abrasive systems, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ NPs have the advantages of high removal efficiency over silica and high selectivity of oxide and nitride [17-22]. However, the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ NPs synthesized by solvothermal, sol-gel, hydrothermal and other methods are commonly irregular in shapes with relatively broad particle-size distributions, which easily scratch surfaces and introduce damages or defects. CMP performance highly depends on the morphologic characteristics of abrasives, and various surface defects may be caused by non-spherical shapes. As a result, the CMP applications of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ NPs in IC manufactures are highly limited by comparison with other spherical abrasives (typically colloidal $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ ). For superior CMP property, spherical particles may be more ideal due to the substitution of sliding friction with rolling friction at the interfacial contact between abrasives and surfaces [17]. However, it is still a challenge for fabricating spherical $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ NPs, and thus restricting further improvement of polishing capability and comprehensive understanding of material removal behavior.

To the best of our knowledge, there are few reports on CMP applications of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ abrasives for improving both surface quality and removal efficiency. Herein, we report a simple one-pot approach for fabricating uniform pure, Zr - and Gd-doped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ nanospheres with high specific area and well-defined structure, as well as their usage as novel abrasives for optimized oxide-CMP performance. The resulting samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM,Raman spectroscopy, diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements. The surface features were evaluated using an atomic force microscope and a non-contact profiler. The developed $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$ abrasives revealed superior CMP performance toward silica films by comparison with the reported results. The possible interfacial contact and removal mechanism of the proposed $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ abrasives were also discussed according to their structure feature and surface chemistry. The aim of work is expected to provide some useful insights into the structure and property regulations of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based abrasives.

## 2. Experimental section

### 2.1. Synthesis

Uniform $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ NPs were prepared via a solvothermal approach [23] with a little modification. In a typical synthesis, 1.5 mL of deionized water was added to 45 mL of ethylene glycol (EG, AR) solution containing 1.5 g of cerium nitrate $\left(\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right.$, AR). And the mixture was ultrasonically treated for 5 min . Then, 1.5 mL of acetic acid $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}\right.$, AR) was added dropwise into the solution mentioned above. After treatment by sonication, the mixed solution was sealed and heated to $180^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 3 h . The resulting precipitates were collected by centrifugation ( 10000 r/min), washed with deionized water and ethanol, dried in air at $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ overnight, and finally calcined at $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in air for 1 h .

For comparison, Zr - and Gd -doped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{pCe}_{1-x} \mathrm{Zr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right.$ and $\mathrm{pCe}_{1-}$ ${ }_{x} \mathrm{Gd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}, x=0.15$ ) NPs were also fabricated according to the procedure descried above with small modifications, where $x$ was the molar ratio of $\mathrm{Zr} /(\mathrm{Ce}+\mathrm{Zr})$ or $\mathrm{Gd} /(\mathrm{Ce}+\mathrm{Gd})$ with a value of 0.15 . Identical conditions as the previous syntheses were applied, except that 1.7 g of Ce $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and 0.16 g of zirconium oxynitrate hydrate (ZrO $\left.\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2} \cdot x \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right.$, AR) were used for the $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$ synthesis. In the case of $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ NPs, 1.7 g of $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and 0.31 g of gadolinium nitrate $\left(\mathrm{Gd}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right.$, AR) were used.

### 2.2. Characterizations

The crystal phases of the products were determined with a D/Max 2500 PC powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku) operating with Cu $\mathrm{K} \alpha(\lambda=1.54056 \AA)$ radiation by $2 \theta$ ranging from $10^{\circ}$ to $80^{\circ}$. Raman spectra was recorded using a DXR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements were performed on a TriStar 3020 analyzer (Micrometrics) at 77 K . The specific surface area was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model, and the pore-size distributions were calculated from the absorption branch data using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. The structure and morphology of the samples were characterized using a SUPRA 55 field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, ZEISS) performing at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV , and a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL) operating at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV . UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer.

### 2.3. CMP experiments

The $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ layer was a 1200-nm thermal oxide film on a 4-inch silicon wafer obtained from Huacheng Changban Microelectronics Co., Ltd. (Changzhou, China), which was cut into square workpieces (ca. 20 mm in width and ca. 0.75 mm in thickness) and mounted on a metal piece for testing. The substrates were polished with the usage of a TegraForce-1/ TegraPol-15 polisher (Struers, Denmark) coupled with a porous polyurethane pad (MD-Chem, Struers) at an applied down pressure of 3.0 psi . The rotation speed of the pad and the head was 90 and 120 rpm , respectively. The polishing time and slurry flow rate was 2 min and 50 $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{min}$, respectively. The polishing slurry mixture with a solid content of $1 \mathrm{wt} \%$ was adjusted to pH 8.5 with the use of 0.1 M NaOH , and was treated by sonication for 10 min prior to use. After CMP experiments, the workpieces were cleaned by sonication in acetone and deionized water, dried and stored in nitrogen prior to further surface analyses.

High-resolution morphology analyses were performed on a Nanoman VS atomic force microscope (AFM, VEECO, currently Bruker) equipped with a Dimension V controller in tapping mode under ambient conditions of $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $40 \%$ relative humidity. Standard silicon AFM probes (Tap300AI-G, BudgetSensors, with aluminum reflective coating) were used in all AFM measurements. The typical tip radius was less than 10 nm and the half cone angle was ca. $10^{\circ}$ at the apex, as specified by the

manufacturer. The scanning rate was 1 Hz , and the pixels per line were 256. And the scanning scale were chosen the same for all AFM experiments $\left(5.0 \times 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)$. For the surfaces before and after CMP, the average roughness (Ra) and root-mean-square (RMS) data were determined within $5.0 \times 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. In addition, the three-dimensional (3D) AFM images and the line-scan profiles were derived from the corresponding two-dimensional (2D) AFM height images using the NanoScope Analysis Software (V 1.40, Bruker).

The surface topographies in a large scale ( $180.8 \times 241.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ ) were also tracked by a 3D non-contact surface profiler (ContourGT-K0, Bruker). Material removal rate (MRR, nm/min) was defined as the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ thickness difference before and after CMP in unit time, and calculated using a weight-loss method [24,25]. The mass difference of the workpiece before and after CMP was measured by analytical electron balance (XS105, Mettler Toledo, Switzerland, exact to 0.01 mg ). Herein, the provided roughness and MRR data were the average of three runs.

## 3. Results and discussion

### 3.1. Structure and morphology analyses

Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-obtained $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2} \mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ samples. The positions of the diffraction peaks and their respective planes in the XRD patterns are well consistent with the reported data of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials (JCPDS 34-0394), confirming the formation of the cubic fluorite crystalline phase [26]. No additional diffraction peaks can be found in the XRD pattern of the $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ products, suggesting that the crystalline phase does not alter when the dopant is added to the host lattice. As estimated by the Scherrer's formula from (111) planes, the crystallite sizes of the pure, Zr -doped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ and Gd -doped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ were calculated to be $7.2 \mathrm{~nm}, 6.8$ nm , and 7.1 nm , respectively. And the lattice parameters of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ NPs were determined to be $5.422 \AA, 5.413 \AA$, and $5.419 \AA$, respectively. In addition, the diffraction peaks of $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$ are slightly shifted towards higher $2 \theta$ values compared to the undoped ones [27]. The ionic radius of $\mathrm{Zr}^{4+}(0.084 \mathrm{~nm})$ and $\mathrm{Gd}^{3+}(0.094 \mathrm{~nm})$ are slightly smaller than that of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}(0.097 \mathrm{~nm})$ [28,29], which is responsible for the high-angle shift and lattice compression.

Raman spectrum is an effective and non-destructive method for detecting structure and surface defects of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials. As illustrated

in Fig. 2, the distinct peaks located at $460-465 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ in the Raman spectra further reveal the $F_{2 g}$ symmetric stretching of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}$ bonds in $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O} 8$ vibrational units of fluorite cubic-phase $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (space group $\mathrm{Fm} 3 \mathrm{~m}$ ). For the Zr - and Gd -doped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ NPs, the presence of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen defects changes $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}$ bond lengths, shifting the $\mathrm{F}_{2 \mathrm{~g}}$ mode center towards relatively high wavenumbers by comparison with undoped ones. Another weak peak at $\sim 600 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ is also assigned to the oxygen related defects in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattices (typically oxygen vacancies) [30]. It commonly recognized that the $I_{600} / I_{460}$ ratio can reflect the oxygen vacancies and lattice deformations. And an increased $I_{600} / I_{460}$ ratio indicates the enhanced content of surface defects (typically $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancies). In this work, the $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ samples exhibit much higher intensity ratio of $I_{600} / I_{460}(0.099$ and 0.104 ) than that of the undoped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ (ca. 0.048 ), suggesting the increased concentrations of oxygen vacancy and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ [31].

The optical properties of the $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeGd}_{0.13} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ were evaluated via UV-vis diffuse absorption spectroscopy. As shown the UV-vis spectra (Fig. 3a), the $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ samples present strong absorption properties in the ultraviolet range. In addition, the absorption edge of the $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}(433 \mathrm{~nm})$ and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}(441 \mathrm{~nm})$ products are shifted over a higher wavelength region (red shift)
compared to the undoped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ ones ( 426 nm ). The red-shift absorption edge of the $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ may be attributed to the charge transfer from $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ to metal atoms, and associated with lattice defects caused by Zr - and Gd-doping. UV-DRS spectra were further transformed using the Kubelka-Munk function to eliminate the band gaps. The plots of K-M function versus the energy of absorbed light are shown in Fig. 3b. The band gap values of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ were calculated to be $3.12 \mathrm{eV}, 3.04 \mathrm{eV}$, and 3.01 eV respectively, indicating that Zr - and Gd-doping can induce the narrowed band gap of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. It is commonly believed that the doping of metal cations in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ contribute to the formation of trivalent cerium $\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right)$ and create more oxygen vacancies. Consequently, the red shifting in the band gap may be attributed to the formation of intermediate state or doping-related transition state [32, 33], originating from the increased concentrations of oxygen vacancy and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. The presented results imply that the $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ possess high $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy concentrations compared to the undoped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ ones. In this work, both Raman and UV-vis results further suggest that the $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ products have the relatively highest contents of surface defects, such as $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy.

Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms of the as-obtained products (Fig. 4a, c, e) exhibit representative type-IV isotherms with type-H2

hysteresis loops, indicating the porous natures of the samples (resulted from the packing of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2} \mathrm{NPs}$ ) [34]. The BET specific area of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$, $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ samples are around $195 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}, 176 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$, and $110 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, d, and f, the pore-size distributions are narrowly distributed and mainly centered below 10 nm . As calculated from the adsorption branch data, the average pore size of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ samples were determined to be 5.1 $\mathrm{nm}, 6.9 \mathrm{~nm}$, and 8.1 nm , respectively.

As shown in Fig. 5a and b, FESEM observations clearly reveal that most $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$ samples have uniform and spherical shapes. The $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ samples present a relatively small particle size ( $60-80 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) compared to that of the $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ ones ( $70-90 \mathrm{~nm}$ ). In addition, TEM observations (Fig. 5c, d, and e) provide more information about the microstructures of the $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2} \mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ products. It demonstrates that the nanospheres are consisted of minor $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ NPs ( $\sim 5 \mathrm{~nm}$ ), and many irregular mesopores coexist. Distinct lattice fringes can also be clearly observed from the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (inset). And the interplanar distances of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ are $0.32 \mathrm{~nm}, 0.31 \mathrm{~nm}$, and 0.31 nm respectively, which can be assigned to the (111) planes of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The slightly reduced lattice spacings also prove the successful Zr - or Gd-doping into $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanocrystals.

### 3.2. CMP performances

### 3.2.1. Surface analysis and removal rate

Surface quality and removal efficiency are crucial evaluating indicators towards successful CMP applications. The type, structure, and property of particle abrasives play a key role in determining the achieved performance. Herein, the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$-CMP tests focused on the dependency of physicochemical properties of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$ abrasives on the final CMP characteristics. In this work, 2D- and 3Dtopography, surface roughness, as well as the line-scan profile of the workpieces before and after CMP were explored using a high-resolution AFM. For sectional profile analyses, the two diagonals in 2D-AFM height images are selected for the line-scan measurements and further comparisons. As presented in Fig. 6a, the color difference or distribution inhomogeneity can be clearly observed from the 2D-AFM height image, implying the rough appearance of the original surface. And the $R a$ and RMS roughness within $1.0 \times 1.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ were measured to be 0.99 nm and 1.25 nm , respectively. The corresponding line-scan trace (Fig. 6b) along the dotted line in the AFM-height image reveals the maximum peak height (MPH) of 2.9 nm and the maximum valley depth (MVD) of 3.2 nm .

AFM results clearly reveal that the proposed $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ abrasives achieve ultra-smooth and damage-free surfaces. As shown in Figs. 7a, 8a and 9a, the improved uniformity in AFM-height

![img-5.jpeg](images\img-5.jpeg)

Fig. 6. 2D-AFM image (a) and the corresponding line-scan profile (b) of the surface prior to CMP.
images suggest superior surface quality and flatness. The $R a$ and RMS roughness within $5.0 \times 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ achieved by $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ abrasives are $0.11 \pm$ 0.02 nm and $0.14 \pm 0.03 \mathrm{~nm}$, which are comparable to those of $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$ ( $0.11 \pm 0.01 \mathrm{~nm} R a, 0.13 \pm 0.01 \mathrm{~nm} R M S$ ) and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}(0.14 \pm 0.03$ $\mathrm{nm} R a, 0.17 \pm 0.03 \mathrm{~nm} R M S$ ) abrasives. It may be attributed to their similar mechanical properties, such as elastic modulus, surface hardness, etc. The pure, Zr - and Gd -doped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ abrasives allow the surfaces to be brought to atomic-scale roughness, illustrating their application potentials in ultra-precise processing. As shown in Fig. 7b, the resulting line-traces (Lines 1 and 2) indicate that the $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ abrasives achieve a topographical variation of $\pm 0.25 \mathrm{~nm}(0.25 \mathrm{~nm}$ of the MPH and 0.18 nm of the MVD). In the case of $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$ (Fig. 8b), the corresponding linetraces (Lines 3 and 4) also reveal a comparable topographical variation of $\pm 0.28 \mathrm{~nm}(0.25 \mathrm{~nm}$ of the MPH and 0.28 nm of the MVD). For the $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ abrasives (Fig. 9b), the line-traces (Lines 5 and 6) demonstrate the MPH of 0.32 nm and the MVD of 0.25 nm . A comparison with the initial surface ( $\pm 3.2 \mathrm{~nm}$, Fig. 6b) clearly confirm that both $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$, $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ abrasives contribute to the obviously improved planarization degrees. The roughness data of the surfaces before and after CMP are summarized in Table 1.

Morphology changes of the surfaces before and after polishing can be distinctly observed from the 3D-AFM images. Compared to the initial

surface (Fig. 10a), most nano-sized asperity peaks were effectively removed by $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$ abrasives (Fig. 10b-d), thereby leading to highly planarized surfaces without introducing other mechanical damages or defects. For tracking surface morphologies in a relatively large scale, the workpieces finished with $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$ abrasives were also detected using a 3D noncontact interferometric microscope. The polished workpieces within $180.8 \times 241.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ reveal flat and smooth appearances, and the surface defects (scratches, pits, residues, etc.) can hardly be found, as shown in Fig. 11.

Removal efficiency is another critical index for CMP performance,

and the average MRR data for pure $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ abrasives are shown in Fig. 12. In this work, the $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ abrasives achieve an average MRR of $88 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ and $109 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ respectively, thus leading to a $44.3 \%$ and $78.7 \%$ enhancement of MRR by comparison with the undoped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ ones $(61 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min})$. In this work, the obtained Zr - and Gd -doped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ abrasives contribute to the oxide removal efficiency enhancement with respect to the pure $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ ones.

surfaces, the atomic surface structures and defects of the Zr - and Gd doped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$, and the material removal mechanism for oxide-CMP with $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ abrasives.

Several investigations [35-39] focused on the effects of mechanical property (especially modulus and hardness) of abrasive particles on the achieved surface quality and MRR. Mathematical modelling and theoretical analysis results proposed that the flexible abrasives with relatively low moduli might deform elastically during the interfacial contact, friction and wear processes. It contributed to an enlarged contact area combined with a reduced contact stress and indentation depth at the tribological interface of abrasive/workpiece. Therefore, the

mechanical damages or defects may be eliminated and the surface quality can be improved. MD simulation results [16] also confirmed that the porous clusters contributed to avoiding hard impact and reducing plough behavior between the particle and the surface, resulting in the plough behavior and mechanical damage reductions. By comparison with solid materials, the porous ones commonly present the evidently reduced moduli and/or hardness, which are highly tunable by adjusting their internal constructions such as pore structure, pore size, pore volume and etc. In this work, we can safely speculate that the as-obtained $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ particles also possess much low moduli with respect to the solid ones. As shown in Fig. 13a, the non-rigid $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ abrasive particles might deform elastically under an applied down pressure during CMP, thus leading to the reductions of the contact pressure at the particle-wafer interface and the indentation depth of the abrasive onto the surface. Based on the discussions described above, both $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ abrasives achieve non-damage and ultra-smooth surfaces with atomic-scale roughness, possibly resulting from the optimized interface contact behavior originated from their porous structures and non-rigid properties.

Manipulating the oxygen vacancy and/or $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration is a popular strategy to optimize the physicochemical performance of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2^{-}}$ based systems [31,40,41]. It is also confirmed that cationic variations in valence (or radius) and/or lattice distortions contribute to the oxygen vacancy and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ enrichments in the doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems. Moreover, it is commonly believed that a mixed valence states of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ coexist in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based materials. In-depth investigations [42,43] further revealed that the active $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ species (or thin $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ layer of several nm in depth) existed at the surfaces of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ NPs. As shown in Fig. 13b, Zr- and Gd-doping treatments also contribute to the oxygen vacancy and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ enrichments at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces, resulting from the reductions of the total positive charges and the oxygen vacancy formation energy of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$.

The material removal mechanism of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ toward $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ can be interpreted by means of the dynamic formation and circular breakage of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds, resulting from the water-associated tribochemical reaction between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ interface [44] and the well-known chem-ical-tooth effect proposed by Cook [45]. In oxide removal processes [45-48], the hydrolysis of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ might occur at weakly alkaline conditions (Reaction 1).
$\mathrm{SiOSi}+H_{2} \mathrm{O} \leftrightarrow \mathrm{SiOH}+\mathrm{SiOH}$
The oxygen vacancies at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces could react with water to form surface hydroxyl groups, which further reacted with the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}^{-}$sites at $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ films to create temporary $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds (Reaction 2).
$\mathrm{SiO}^{-}+\mathrm{CeOH} \rightarrow \mathrm{SiOCe}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}$
Consequently, the effective oxide removal can be achieved via the dynamic formation and breakage of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonding (so-called solidstate tribochemical reaction), as shown in Fig. 13c.

The structural defects in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, such as $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy, play a key role in determining the potential applications and attractive characteristics of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based materials. And the surface defects (typically $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy) of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ NPs can also be created and controlled by metal-doping treatments [31,41,42,49,50]. In oxide-CMP applications, the experimental investigations and theoretical simulations [18,19,21,22,44-48,51-55] confirmed that the formed $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive surfaces contributed to the
enhancement of tribochemical activity between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$, thereby leading to an improved of material removal efficiency. Recently, Kim and coworkers [21,22] proposed the improved removal rate in oxide-CMP by forming oxygen vacancies in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives via UV-irradiation or lanthanide (La and Nd)-doping treatment. As revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, more oxygen vacancies led to increased $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ contents at the surfaces of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles after UV-irradiation treatments. Furthermore, it was also confirmed that the removal rate of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ against $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ gradually raised as the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and/or oxygen vacancy concentrations increased. There was a reliable correlation between the removal efficiency and the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surface defects (typically $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy).

In this work, both Raman and UV-vis-DRS spectra indicate that Zr and Gd-doping in $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ are responsible for the formation of more oxygen vacancies, thereby leading to more $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ as reactive sites. And the $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ NPs possess the highest $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy concentrations. The increased surface defects (reactive sites) are expected to improve the tribochemical activity of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ abrasives and promote the chemical bonding between ceria and silica, thus accelerating the formation and breakage of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds. Consequently, the as-prepared $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ abrasives achieved the improvement of material removal toward silica films by comparison with the undoped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ ones. As confirmed by $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ adsorption-desorption measurements, the $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}(6.9 \mathrm{~nm})$ and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ NPs $(8.1 \mathrm{~nm})$ also present a larger average pore-size than that of the undoped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}(5.1 \mathrm{~nm})$. According the MD simulations [16], the enlarged pore-size might also contribute to the increased actual contact areas between porous abrasives and substrate surfaces, possibly resulting from the elastic deform of low-modulus particles. In addition, the expanded pore-size might also contribute to the enhanced adhesion and pulling effects of abrasives to surfaces. Furthermore, the water-involved tribochemical wear [56] might occur at interfacial contact, and thus facilitate the tribochemical reaction and material removal. All these factors are beneficial to the MRR increasement for the Zr - and Gd -doped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ abrasives. By comparison with pure $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}(61 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min})$ and $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}(88 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min})$, the highest MRR $(109 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min})$ achieved by $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ abrasives may be attributed to the enhanced oxygen vacancy and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentrations, as well as the expanded pore diameter.

This work provides promising and effective $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based abrasive materials having good potential of practical applications for achieving high-quality and high-efficiency oxide-CMP. Further works on the structure, component, property optimizations, as well as the oxide removal mechanism of pure and doped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ abrasives are ongoing in our group.

## 4. Conclusions

1. Nanosized porous $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}\right), \mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ spherical abrasives were prepared via a hydrothermal approach and applied in oxide-CMP applications. The pure $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ abrasives achieved the ultra-smooth and non-damage surfaces with average roughness of 0.11 nm Ra and 0.14 nm RMS, which were comparable to those of $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}(0.11 \mathrm{~nm} R a, 0.13 \mathrm{~nm} R M S)$ and $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}(0.14 \mathrm{~nm} R a, 0.17$ nm RMS).
2. The developed abrasives contributed to the topographical variation reductions, the surface planarization improvements, as well as the

surface defect eliminations. It might be attributed to the enlarged contact area, reduced contact stress, and decreased indentation depth between abrasives and surfaces, possibly originating from their porous nanostructures and non-rigid characteristics.
3. As expected, the $\mathrm{pCeZrO}_{2}(88 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min})$ and $\mathrm{pCeGdO}_{2}$ abrasives ( 109 $\mathrm{nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ) achieved ca. $44.3 \%$ and $78.7 \%$ MRR increments compared to the undoped $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}(61 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min})$.

More direct and solid evidence is still needed to explore the relation among the structure characteristics (specific area, pore size, porosity, etc.), mechanical properties (hardness, modulus, etc.), surface chemistry (typically $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy) and oxide-CMP performance of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ abrasives.
