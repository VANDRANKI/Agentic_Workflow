#### Abstract

The effectiveness of silicon carbide ( SiC ) planarization mostly relies on the chemical and mechanical effects during chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). Nevertheless, the alumina $\left(\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ abrasive only provides a mechanical effect and is incapable of achieving a high-efficiency polishing of SiC . To address this issue, a series of novel $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasives were prepared by encapsulating varying amounts of manganese dioxide $\left(\mathrm{MnO}_{2}\right)$ on $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive, and the polishing performance on SiC wafers was evaluated. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, along with the size and zeta potential data, show that $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ is successfully coated on the surface of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$, and the dispersion of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive is significantly improved when compared with the pure $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$. Furthermore, the CMP experiment and surface profile analysis demonstrate that the material removal rate (MRR) can reach a maximum value of $640.47 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{h}$ when using a $0.05 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$-coated $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ composite abrasive, which is $76 \%$ higher than that of traditional $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive. Furthermore, the average surface roughness ( Sa , arithmetic mean height) of SiC is reduced to 0.73 nm . X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results reveal that the surface of SiC is oxidized and forms a chemical bond known as Mn-O-Si after CMP. The results of the friction coefficient test and contact angle test indicate that slurries containing composite abrasive have exceptional wettability and a higher friction coefficient. Under the synergistic chemical and mechanical effects, SiC is oxidized to soft oxide and then removed circularly to reach excellent flatness.


## 1. Introduction

The third-generation semiconductor material silicon carbide ( SiC ) has better physical properties than traditional semiconductors, such as large band gap, high breakdown voltage, and high thermal conductivity. As a result, SiC is extensively utilized in high-frequency, high-power devices [1]. To attain widespread use, the epitaxial layer necessitates a SiC substrate that possesses a high-quality surface characterized by a surface roughness of less than 1 nm root mean square and an undamaged lattice structure [2]. Currently, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) removes the rough peaks and defects on the surface of the materials through the synergistic effect of chemistry and machinery to obtain a high-precision smooth surface, so it has become the most effective
technology for global and local planarization of the wafer [3]. Due to the strong chemical inertness and the high hardness of the Si-face surface of SiC , the material removal rate (MRR) of the C -face surface is typically higher than that of the Si-face surface. Therefore, enhancing the MRR on the Si-face surface is a current research focus until mass production is accomplished [4].

It was found that the rate-limiting step in the total CMP process was the surface oxidation reaction of SiC [5]. Scholars have recently focused on utilizing oxidants to oxidize SiC into the transition oxidation state of $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}$, so that the mechanical effect of abrasive removes the soft oxide [6]. To achieve such an oxidation state of SiC , numerous researchers conduct scientific studies. Ni et al. [7] conducted a comparison of CMP performance on the Si surface of the $6 \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{SiC}$ (0001) wafer using two

strong oxidants, namely potassium permanganate $\left(\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}\right)$ and hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$. Under identical pH conditions, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ can undergo oxidation by $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ to produce $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, demonstrating that $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ have a greater capability for oxidation. The relative percentage content of chemical composition on the polished SiC surface was obtained. It was found that the oxidation product ( $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}, \mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}_{x}-\mathrm{C}_{y}, \mathrm{Si}_{4} \mathrm{C}_{4-4} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Si}_{4} \mathrm{C}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{4}$ ) content of SiC polished by $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ is higher than polished by $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$. Chen et al. [8] investigated the use of colloidal silica and ceria-based slurries, together with $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$, to achieve a higher MRR in the CMP process of a $\mathrm{6H}-\mathrm{SiC}(0001)$ substrate. The results demonstrated that the smooth surface with the average surface roughness (Ra) of 0.11 nm and the large MRR of $1089 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{h}$ were attained in the strong acid environment. Wang et al. [9] studied the polishing characteristics of $4 \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{SiC}(0001)$ using $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ as an abrasive, $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ as an oxidant, and ferric nitrate as a chemical additive. The experiment demonstrated that adding 0.5 wt\% ferric nitrate resulted in a $34 \%$ increase in the material removal rate of $4 \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{SiC}$ compared with that without ferric nitrate. Additionally, the surface roughness Ra decreased from 0.123 nm to 0.110 nm . By analyzing the 2 p spectrum of Si , it can be observed that in an acidic environment, the O atom only attacks the C atom and generates the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}$ structure, but after adding ferric nitrate, the O atom attacks not only the C atom but also Si atom, generating $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}_{x}-\mathrm{C}_{y}$ structure. Zhao et al. [10] studied the high-quality polishing of SiC using manganese (Mn) -based slurry. In alkaline conditions, $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ can be transformed into $\mathrm{MnO}^{2-}$ ions, which enhances the solid-phase chemical reaction at the interface, causes the oxidation reaction of the matrix's surface atoms, weakens the molecular bonds of SiC. Finally, the MRR is improved and the Ra reaches 1 nm . However, simply changing the composition of the slurry formula is not enough to effectively improve the MRR. As a result, it is possible to achieve SiC planarization by changing the structure of the abrasive.

Abrasive is one of the key factors in determining the quality of polishing, and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive hardness (the Mohs hardness is 9 [11]) is higher and more suitable for polishing hard and brittle materials such as SiC [12,13]. Su et al. [14] examined how the composition of the polishing slurry affects the MRR of SiC substrate based on $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive in CMP. The polished surface can achieve a surface roughness of less than 1 nm . Nevertheless, $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive has obvious disadvantages in CMP, such as excessive hardness and poor suspension stability and dispersion, which frequently lead to additional surface flaws [15]. Li et al. [16] used 2D layered zirconium phosphate (ZrP) and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ as hybrid abrasive, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a dispersant to prepare environment-friendly and efficient aluminum alloy CMP slurry. The dispersion stability was enhanced as a result of the hydrogen bond interaction between the hybrid abrasive produced by PEG. Simultaneously, $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$, a widely used catalyst support material, has been coupled with other common nanomaterials to create diverse core-shell structures [17]. These structures find extensive applications in the field of CMP. Lei et al. [18] studied the CMP performance of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} / \mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ core-shell abrasive on a hard disk matrix. The experiment revealed that the quantity of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ coating had a significant impact on the MRR. Additionally, the slurry with a core-shell structure exhibited lower surface roughness and fewer scratches compared to the slurry containing pure $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$. Wang et al. [19] studied the CMP performance of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} /$ metatitanic acid composite abrasive with the core-shell structure on the sapphire substrate. The presence of a core-shell structure enhances both the surface quality and MRR due to the catalytic effect of the solid-phase chemical reaction occurring between metatitanic acid-coated $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ and the sapphire substrate during the polishing process. Achieving an atomic surface with high MRR in CMP poses a difficulty due to the need to balance chemical and mechanical impacts [20]. Herein, certain academics aim to change the imbalance between chemical and mechanical impacts by modifying the quantity of coating on the shell in the core-shell structure. Their objective is to determine the ideal coating amount that yields the maximum MRR. Yuan et al. [21] synthesized a series of composite abrasives called zeolite imidazolium cerium oxide
$\left(\mathrm{CeO}_{2} @ \mathrm{ZIF}-8\right)$ to enhance the concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. This was achieved by varying the quantity of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) material throughout the growth process. At a ZIF-8 concentration of 1.95 wt $\%$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2} @ \mathrm{ZIF}-8$ composite abrasive, the MRR is $28 \%$ greater than that of pure ceria abrasive. Additionally, the average surface roughness (Sa), which measures the arithmetic mean height, is only 1.23 nm . Kurokawa et al. [22] achieved efficient CMP of SiC substrates by using $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ slurry instead of silica slurry, adding the strong oxidant $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$, and introducing oxygen to increase the MRR. $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ can be transformed into $\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{2-}$ in a high pH environment, which existed in ionic form and has the advantage of being easier to react, promoting the oxidation process. Yin et al. [23] exploited the multi-valence and oxidation-reduction characteristics of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ particles to develop a new $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ slurry for efficient and high-quality chemical mechanical polishing of SiC wafer. Experiments showed that $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ particles were easily converted into $\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}$ions in alkaline environment, and the strong oxidation of $\mathrm{MnO}_{4}^{-}$ ions greatly improved the polishing efficiency. To summarize, $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$, which is the most appropriate abrasive for SiC polishing, can be enhanced through structural innovation. $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$, a common transition metal oxide catalyst, has garnered significant interest owing to its notable attributes including elevated catalytic activity, thermal stability, affordability, and facile production [24]. Hence, it can be deemed advantageous to amalgamate with $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ in order to fabricate a novel form of composite abrasive.

Based on these studies, a novel $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ core-shell structure nanocomposite abrasive that accelerates chemical reaction rate is prepared. This nanocomposite abrasive accelerates the pace of chemical reactions. By adjusting the amount of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ shell, the most suitable amount of coating to achieve the best CMP performance of SiC is found. The microstructure of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), particle size distribution, CMP performance was tested by polishing experiment, three-dimensional optical profilometer, and polishing mechanism was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle test and friction coefficient test.

## 2. Experiment

### 2.1. Chemicals

The $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive was acquired from Shanghai Yingzhi Abrasive Materials Co., Ltd (China), potassium permanganate $\left(\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}\right)$, hydrochloric acid (HCl), and nitric acid $\left(\mathrm{HNO}_{3}\right)$ came from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd (China). All reagents do not require further purification.

### 2.2. Preparation of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasives

$\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ is grown on $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ by a simple chemical deposition method. First, 15 g $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ was added to 100 g deionized water, and an $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ suspension was obtained after ultrasound for 25 min . To properly disperse the $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$, a three-neck flask with the suspension was heated in a $50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ water bath and magnetically agitated for 30 min . Then, 0.1669 g $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ and $5 \mathrm{~mL} 3 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{HCl}$ were added to the $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ dispersion and stirred. When dark brown solids appeared in the flask, the reaction stopped. Finally, the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min , washed three times continuously with deionized water and absolute ethanol, and dried at $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 12 h . The $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive (the mass ratio of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ is $0.50 \mathrm{wt} \%$ ) was prepared, denoted as $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.50 \mathrm{wt} \%)$. To compare the impact of varying coating amounts on the polishing properties of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive, a series of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasives with different contents of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ were prepared by changing the added amount of $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ in the above synthesis process. The mass ratio of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ in these abrasives was $0.01 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.03 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.05 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.3 \mathrm{wt}$ $\%$, and $0.5 \mathrm{wt} \%$, respectively. In addition, $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ abrasive was prepared

by the same method as the reference. $0.1669 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ and $5 \mathrm{~mL} 3 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ HCl were added to 100 g of deionized water to stir, and the reaction was stopped when dark brown substances appeared in the flask. The samples were centrifuged at 5000 rmp for 5 min , washed three times sequentially with deionized water and absolute ethanol, and dried at $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 12 h . Finally, $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ abrasive is obtained.

### 2.3. Polishing performance test

The polishing experiment was carried out with 1.5 wt\% $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive. 6 g abrasive was added into 400 mL deionized water, while $4 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$ was added as an oxidizer. The pH was adjusted with $3 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ dilute $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ as a pH regulator, and the slurry was ultrasonic for 20 min . As a reference, pure $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ polishing liquid was made using the same method.

A UNIPOL-1502 polishing machine (Shenyang Kejing Co., Ltd., China) was used to polish $4 \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{SiC}$ (0001, the diameter of 2 inches, Shandong SICC Co., Ltd. China). The polishing pad was Suba 800 (Dow Chemical Co., Ltd., USA), and the setting parameters of polishing are shown in Table 1. Following the polishing process, SiC substrate was cleaned with acetone, cleaning agent, ethanol, and deionized water successively, dried in the oven at $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 30 min , cooled in the drying dish for 30 min , and then weighed. The formula for material removal rate (MRR) is as follows:
$M R R=\frac{\Delta m \times 10^{4}}{\rho \pi R^{2} \tau}$
Where, MRR: material removal rate ( $\mu \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{h}$ ); $\Delta \mathrm{m}$ : quality of SiC substrate removal before and after polishing (g); $\rho$ : the density of SiC substrate $\left(\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\right.$, and $\rho_{\mathrm{SiC}}=3.16 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ); R: radius of SiC substrate (cm); $\tau$ : polishing time (h)

### 2.4. Characterization

The XRD patterns of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive was determined by Cu K $\alpha$ radiation by X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan). The operating voltage and current of the X-ray tubes were fixed at 40 kV and 40 mA , respectively. The scanning speed was set at $8^{\circ} \mathrm{min}^{-1}$, and the step size was $0.02^{\circ}$. Intensity data were collected in the range of $20=$ $20^{\circ}-80^{\circ}$. The morphology of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive was characterized by SEM (JSM-7500F, JEOL Ltd, Japan) at an accelerated voltage of 10.0 kV . Particle size distribution and Zeta potential test of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ were determined by Nano ZS90 Zetasizer (Malvern Panalytical Ltd, UK). Before particle size and zeta potential testing, the abrasive was dispersed in deionized water. Different pH values of the system were adjusted with $0.1 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{NaOH}$ and $0.1 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{HCl}$ solutions, and tested after ultrasound for 10 min .

The mean surface roughness (Sa, arithmetic mean height) of SiC before and after polishing was measured by a three-dimensional optical profilometer (S neox 090, Sensofar S.L.). The pixel size was $0.69 \mu \mathrm{~m} /$ pixel. The Z-scan was $596 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, and the measuring area was $500 \mu \mathrm{~m} \times$ $500 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. SiC surface before and after CMP was studied by XPS (Thermo Scientific K-Alpha, USA), and C1s peak was calibrated at 284.8 eV by focusing monochromatic Al K $\alpha$ radiation. The contact angle of slurry drops on SiC substrate surface was obtained by dynamic contact angle

and penetration analyzer (BIOLIN Theta Flex, Sweden). The experiment was repeated three times for each group. SiC polishing environment was simulated using a Byes-550 friction meter (Bangyi Precision Measuring Instrument Shanghai Co., Ltd., China.), and the friction coefficient between SiC substrate and the $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive coated with different $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ amounts was measured.

## 3. Results and discussion

### 3.1. Structure and morphology analysis of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive

### 3.1.1. XRD analysis

Fig. 1 is the XRD pattern of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.50 \mathrm{wt} \%)$ composite abrasive. Pure $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ (prepared in section 2.2) and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive were also evaluated as references. As shown in Fig. 2, $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ has diffraction peaks at $25.7^{\circ}, 37.5^{\circ}$, and $65.1^{\circ}(20)$ corresponding to the (220), (211), and (002) crystal faces, which are consistent with the $\alpha-\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ image of the standard tetragonal system I4/m (PDF\#44-0141) [25]. $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.50 \mathrm{wt} \%)$ composite abrasive has two kinds of diffraction peaks of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$. The $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ peaks occur at the following angles: $25.6^{\circ}, 35.2^{\circ}, 37.8^{\circ}, 43.4^{\circ}, 46.2^{\circ}, 52.5^{\circ}, 57.5^{\circ}, 59.7^{\circ}, 61.3^{\circ}$, $66.5^{\circ}, 68.2^{\circ}$ and $76.9^{\circ}$. The peaks are sharp, strong, and exhibit good crystallinity, corresponding with the $\alpha-\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ image of the standard tripartite system R3c (PDF\#10-0173) [26]. The peaks of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ are at $25.7^{\circ}, 37.5^{\circ}$, and $65.1^{\circ}$. The low intensity of the $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ diffraction peak in $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ may be due to the low content of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ and the weak crystallinity [27]. The XRD results show that $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ coexist in $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.50 \mathrm{wt} \%)$ composite abrasive, and $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ is successfully synthesized on $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$.

### 3.1.2. SEM images, size distribution, and zeta position

To clearly demonstrate the typical morphology and dispersion of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.50 \mathrm{wt} \%)$ composite abrasive, SEM images were taken at the same multiples. Irregular polygonal $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive is shown in Fig. 2a. The aggregation of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive is significant due to its high surface energy and van der Waals forces [28]. Fig. 2b shows the $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.50 \mathrm{wt} \%)$ composite abrasive. Due to the addition of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$, the dispersion of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.50 \mathrm{wt} \%)$ composite abrasive was significantly improved compared with pure $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive [21]. The energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) results of region A of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ and region B of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.50 \mathrm{wt} \%)$ composite abrasive are shown

in Fig. 2c and d respectively. By comparison, the surface of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ coated $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ (Fig. 2d) contains $\mathrm{O}, \mathrm{Al}$, and Mn components, whereas $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ (Fig. 2e) does not exhibit any Mn peak. SEM and EDS image results confirmed the successful loading of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ on $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$, and the presence of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ improved the agglomeration of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.50 \mathrm{wt} \%$ ) composite abrasive.

Based on the literature, the formation of the hard agglomeration of abrasives in the polishing fluid may cause scratches on the substrate, so it is crucial to enhance the dispersion stability of abrasives [29]. Fig. 3 shows the particle size distribution of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive with different $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ contents at $\mathrm{pH}=2$. At coating amounts ranging from $0.01 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $0.30 \mathrm{wt} \%$, the sample exhibits a

Fig. 3. Size distribution of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive ( pH $=2$ ).
narrow peak, and the particle size distribution of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive is narrower and smaller than that of pure $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$. When the coating amount is $0.5 \mathrm{wt} \%$, the sample shows a wide peak. This indicates that adding an appropriate amount of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ on the abrasive can effectively alleviate the agglomeration phenomenon. This finding is consistent with the SEM results of the composite abrasive.

Furtherly, the zeta potential is closely related to the dispersion stability of the polishing slurry. When the absolute value of the zeta potential is greater than 30 mV , the stability of the polishing slurry improves as a result of the electrostatic repulsion between abrasive [30]. Fig. 4 shows the zeta potential of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.50 \mathrm{wt} \%$ ) composite abrasive at different pH values. When pH is less than 6 , the

Fig. 4. The zeta potential of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.50 \mathrm{wt} \%$ ) composite abrasive at different pH values.

absolute value of the zeta potential of composite abrasive is greater than that of pure $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive, indicating that composite abrasive has better dispersion stability under strong acid condition [31]. It can also be seen from Fig. 3 that the particle size of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.01-0.30 \mathrm{wt}$ \%) composite abrasives is smaller, indicating an enhancement in the agglomeration of pure alumina and increased dispersion stability of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.01-0.30 \mathrm{wt} \%)$ composite abrasives [32]. On the other hand, adding varying amounts of manganese will result in variable surface properties, and the isoelectric point will change with the change in the surface properties of the abrasive [33]. As shown in Fig. 4, the isoelectric point of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ is 9.2 , while that of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.50 \mathrm{wt} \%)$ is 8.6. Compared with pure $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive, the isoelectric point shifts towards lower pH values, which may be connected to an increase in $\mathrm{Mn}^{4+}$ concentration. Consistent with the previous testing, the composite abrasive loaded with $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ exhibited superior stability and dispersion in acidic conditions, which is advantageous for subsequent polishing performance experiments.

Based on the above structural and morphological testing, it is evident that $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ is successfully loaded on the external surface of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$, and the $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.50 \mathrm{wt} \%)$ composite abrasive has improved dispersion and stability in acidic conditions.

### 3.2. CMP performance

Material removal rate (MRR) is one of the crucial metric to evaluate the CMP performance [34]. The enhanced performance of CMP is a result of a synergistic effect of chemical and mechanical actions. Insufficient mechanical action delays the removal of SiC oxide layer, while excessive mechanical action can cause surface defects by creating scratches on SiC surface [11,35]. Therefore, the issue of the balance between chemical and mechanical effects in the CMP process is of utmost importance.

Fig. 5 illustrates the impact of varying $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ content on the MRR of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive. The pure $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive is indicated as a reference. The MRR of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive initially increases with the increase of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ content. At the $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ coating amount of $0.05 \mathrm{wt} \%$, the maximum MRR reaches $640.47 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{h}$, which is $76 \%$ higher than the MRR of pure $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive ( $364.50 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{h}$ ). At coating amounts exceeding $0.05 \mathrm{wt} \%$, the MRR gradually decreases. According to the variation of MRR, it can be inferred that the oxidation rate may gradually increase in the beginning stage when the coating amount is below $0.05 \mathrm{wt} \%$, and the removal rate of the generated oxide is also gradually increasing. When the coating amount is exceeds 0.05 wt $\%$, excessive $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ coating might diminish the mechanical action and

hardness of composite abrasives. Therefore, the high MRR of SiC was attained and the ideal balance between mechanical and chemical effects was reached at $0.05 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ coating.

In the process of CMP, it is expected to obtain higher MRR and a surface with less damage at the nanoscale. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the surface roughness of the substrate. Fig. 6 shows the surface profile comparison of SiC in three different environments. SiC substrate in its unpolished state exhibits a surface that is characterized by prominent big pores and a surface roughness of up to 3.31 nm . Polishing SiC surface with $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive resulted in a decrease in surface roughness to 2.70 nm . However, obvious scratches appeared on SiC surface. After polishing with $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.05 \mathrm{wt} \%)$ composite abrasive, the Sa of SiC was effectively decreased to 1.50 nm , and the surface roughness was reduced without obvious scratches and holes. It is possible that the hardness, angular and irregular shape of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive may produce more mechanical action than chemical activity, leading to visible scratches on the substrate's surface [36]. The Mohs hardness of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ is lower than that of alumina [37]. Therefore, $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.05 \mathrm{wt} \%)$ composite abrasive can reduce the scratches and improved surface quality of the substrate.

Based on the aforementioned experiments, the best CMP performance is attained when the amount of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ coating is $0.05 \mathrm{wt} \%$.

### 3.3. Analysis of the polishing mechanism

The mechanism of the CMP process is complex, the best performance can be obtained when the chemical and mechanical effects reach the dynamic balance, thus the two aspects are discussed. According to the previous CMP performance test, taking $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.05 \mathrm{wt} \%)$ composite abrasive as an example, the polishing mechanism of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ coating $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ on SiC substrate is analyzed. The oxidation rate plays a crucial role in the process of polishing silicon carbide, as it directly affects the MRR [38]. The oxidation of SiC surface before and after the CMP was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the results are shown in Fig. 7. Narrow scan spectra of Si 2 p and C 1 s were obtained (Fig. 8) to further illustrate the degree of oxidation on SiC surface, and manganese was observed on the substrate surface after CMP (Fig. 9).

By comparing the XPS scan full spectrum of $4 \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{SiC}$ (0001) before and after CMP (Fig. 7), the presence of Mn element is observed in the spectrum after CMP. Curve (a) suggests that new compounds containing Mn element have formed on the surface of SiC. However, further analysis of the specific valence state requires analysis of the narrow scan spectra.

According to the Si 2 p spectral analysis of Fig. 8, the binding energies of Si 2 p before CMP are 100.1 eV and 102.1 eV , corresponding to $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}$ [9], with higher $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}$ peak and lower $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}$ peak. After CMP, the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}$ binding is significantly reduced, while the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}$ intensity is increased, indicating that oxidation reaction may occur on the surface of SiC [39]. In addition, there is a peak of binding energy of 104.3 eV , corresponding to $\mathrm{SiO}_{4} \mathrm{C}_{p}$ [40], which is also the oxidation product of SiC . According to the C 1 s spectral analysis of Fig. 8, the binding energy of C 1 s before CMP is observed at 282.1 eV, 284.9 eV, 286.1 eV, 288.5 eV, corresponding to $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{Si}, \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{O}$, and $\mathrm{C} \fallingdotseq \mathrm{O}$, respectively. The peak of C-C binding energy could be attributed to the adhesion of C substances on the polished SiC surface or the pollution of C -containing substances in the environment [41]. After CMP, the new C -O peak is enhanced, and C -Si oxidation products $\mathrm{Si}_{4} \mathrm{C}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{4}(285.1 \mathrm{eV})$ and $\mathrm{Si}_{4} \mathrm{C}_{4-\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}(282.8 \mathrm{eV})$ appear on SiC surface [42], further indicating that SiC surface was oxidized.

In addition, Fig. 9 illustrates the appearance of Mn elements on SiC surface in the XPS scan spectrum after CMP. The binding energy of Mn 2p $1 / 2$ and Mn 2p $3 / 2$ is 653.9 eV and 643.4 eV , corresponding to the $\mathrm{Mn}-\mathrm{O}$ bond in $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$, and the binding energy of 641.9 corresponds to $\mathrm{Mn}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bond [43,44]. This could be because the $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ in the slurry reacts with the oxidation products of SiC to generate $\mathrm{Mn}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds. The XPS results reveal the formation of new oxides on the surface of SiC

after CMP. The surface of SiC polished by $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ ( 0.05 wt\%) composite abrasive generates a soft oxide layer, which can be removed easily.

In addition to chemical actions, mechanical actions are also crucial in CMP, and therefore $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive needs to be explained in terms of mechanical mechanisms [45]. In this work, contact angle and friction coefficient experiments were used to examine the interaction between the $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive and SiC in the CMP experiment.

Fig. 10 illustrates the contact angles of different abrasive with SiC substrate. It can be observed that the maximum contact angle of pure $\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ abrasive slurry on SiC substrate is $65.90^{\circ}$ (Fig. 10a). When the amount of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ coating is $0.05 \mathrm{wt} \%$, the minimum value of contact angle is $37.45^{\circ}$. The hydrophobicity of SiC makes the initial contact angle larger [15]. After the $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ coated with $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$, the composite
abrasive becomes soft and prone to elastic deformation. This efficiently expands the contact area with SiC substrate surface and enhances the spreading ability, resulting in a decrease in the contact angle. When the $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ loading is too large, the composite abrasive aggregation leads to the increase of particle size, and the hydrophobicity of the composite abrasive increases, thus the contact area between the abrasive and SiC substrate decreases [28,46,47]. In general, the composite abrasive effectively increases the wettability of the polishing slurry.

On the other hand, the coefficient of dynamic friction is also a research object of mechanical effects. It is shown that the MRR increases with the increase of the dynamic friction coefficient between the abrasive and SiC substrate [48]. In this experiment, the CMP environment during the polishing process was simulated using a dynamic friction coefficient meter. Fig. 11 shows the dynamic friction coefficient between different $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive and SiC substrate. The

![img-8.jpeg](images\img-8.jpeg)

initial dynamic friction coefficient of pure $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ as an abrasive is merely 0.18 . However, after $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ coating, the dynamic friction coefficient gradually increased, reaching a maximum value of 0.24 . Due to the smaller hardness of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$, it may be more likely to produce deformation, which increases the contact area between the abrasive and wafer.
![img-9.jpeg](images\img-9.jpeg)

Therefore, the dynamic friction coefficient is positively correlated with the mechanical effect. Nevertheless, if the amount of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ coating is excessive, the aggregation of composite abrasives reduces the amount of effective abrasives, which reduces the MRR [47]. This is similar with the earlier MRR results in CMP performance.

In order to illustrate the interaction between composite abrasive and SiC substrate more visually, the contact wear model between $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.05 \mathrm{wt} \%$ ) composite abrasive and SiC substrate is established in Fig. 12. Under acidic conditions, SiC is oxidized to soft
$\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ under the action of $\mathrm{KMnO}_{4}$, reacts with the coated $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ to form $\mathrm{Mn}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds, and is finally removed by the mechanical action of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$.

## 4. Conclusion

In this paper, a series of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$-coated $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ composite abrasive was prepared, and the coating amount of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ was changed to study the best CMP performance on SiC substrate. The XRD results show that $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ is successfully coated on the outer surface of $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$. SEM and size distribution results show that the addition of $\mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ improves the dispersibility. Zeta potential analysis results reveal that the $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}$ composite abrasive exhibits excellent dispersion stability in acidic conditions. The CMP tests indicate that the best polishing performance is achieved by using the $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.05 \mathrm{wt} \%$ ) composite abrasive, which results in a maximum MRR of $640.47 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{h}$ and minimum Sa of 1.5 nm . By analyzing the polishing mechanism, the surface of SiC is oxidized to $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ after composite abrasive polishing, and the $\mathrm{Mn}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bond is formed to accelerate the chemical reaction rate. The $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} @ \mathrm{MnO}_{2}(0.05 \mathrm{wt} \%$ ) composite abrasive exhibits the lowest contact angle and the highest dynamic friction coefficient on SiC substrate, which enhances the mechanical action in CMP and leads to an improvement in the MRR.
