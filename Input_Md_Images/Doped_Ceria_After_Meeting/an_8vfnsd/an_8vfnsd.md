A series of carbon spheres coated with Rare-Earth ion-doped $\left(\mathrm{La}^{3+}, \mathrm{Sm}^{3+}, \mathrm{Y}^{3+}, \mathrm{Yb}^{3+}\right) \mathrm{CeO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}\right)$ were synthesized using eco-friendly hydrothermal and chemical precipitation methods. The structural characteristics of the abrasives were thoroughly analyzed using XRD, SEM, TEM, and FT-IR techniques. A detailed analysis of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and Vo concentrations on the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ layer surface was conducted using XPS and Raman spectroscopy. The analysis results indicated that $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives exhibited the highest $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}(46.23 \%)$ and Vo ( $25.39 \%$ ) concentrations. Additionally, the polishing performance of the abrasives was evaluated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive exhibited superior polishing performance, achieving the lowest surface roughness ( $\mathrm{Ra}=0.26 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) compared to commercial abrasives ( $\mathrm{Ra}=0.77 \mathrm{~nm}$ ), reducing Ra by $66.23 \%$. Moreover, density functional theory with the Hubbard U method (DFT+U) was used to systematically investigate the oxygen vacancy formation energy, structural stability, and electronic properties of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ doped with RareEarth ions. These findings demonstrate that doping with Rare-Earth ions possessing ionic radii close to that of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ effectively enhances the concentration of oxygen vacancies and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions, which is crucial for improving polishing performance. This work provides valuable reference data on the doping of Rare-Earth ions in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2^{-}}$ based polishing abrasives.

## 1. Introduction

With advancing integrated circuit manufacturing technology, the precision requirements for planarizing semiconductor materials have consistently increased [1]. Consequently, developing advanced Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) processes has become essential [2]. The effectiveness of CMP depends on the development and application of abrasives with high polishing rates, excellent flatness, and high selectivity, among which metal oxide nanoparticles (such as $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}[3]$, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}[4]$, and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}[5]$ ) are widely used. Compared to abrasives like $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$, which rely solely on mechanical interactions for material removal [6], $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ exhibits a unique chemical tooth effect when polishing silicon-based materials, such as silicon dioxide and silicon
nitride, resulting in superior polishing quality [7]. Furthermore, cerium is abundant, inexpensive, and easy to process, simplifying the preparation of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and promoting its application as an abrasive in CMP processes [8].

Research shows that $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ enhance chemical reactivity, facilitating the cleavage of Si-O bonds during the CMP process [9]. Consequently, numerous studies have aimed to increase the concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}[10-13]$. Fan et al.[14] synthesized $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanomaterials doped with $\mathrm{La}^{3+}, \mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$, and $\mathrm{Eu}^{3+}$ ions using an oil-bath method. Following doping, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration increased from $49 \%$ to $56 \%$. The material removal rate ( $174.3 \pm 7.6 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ) and surface roughness ( $\mathrm{Ra}=0.36 \pm 0.05 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) both improved. Ma et al.[15] synthesized a series of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ with varying dopant types and amounts using the molten

salt method, finding that doping significantly improved abrasive efficiency. The material removal rate (MRR) of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives doped with $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}, \mathrm{La}^{3+}$, and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ increased by $56 \%, 40 \%$, and $44 \%$, respectively. Ion doping is clearly an effective method to enhance $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration, and the underlying mechanism has garnered significant research attention. Han et al. [16] systematically studied the electronic properties and defect chemistry of Gd-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ using density functional theory (DFT). They found that Gd-VO-Gd cluster formation has minimal impact on the defect chemistry of oxygen vacancies, and Gd doping effectively lowers oxygen vacancy formation energy. However, examining the effect of a single dopant on oxygen vacancy formation energy is not particularly decisive for selecting an appropriate dopant. Liu et al.[17] used hybrid density functional theory (DFT) calculations to systematically investigate oxygen vacancy formation energy and its influence on the electronic properties of transition metal-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The results indicate that dopants causing minimal structural distortion and ionic charge variation tend to bind more effectively with $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and exhibit lower oxygen vacancy formation energy. On the flip side, traditional $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives relying solely on simple chemical modification often exhibit uncontrolled morphology and size, leading to mechanical damage (e.g., scratches and secondary damage) during material removal, significantly constraining their utility in CMP processes [18]. Recently, core-shell structured abrasives have been introduced to CMP to address this issue [19], [20], [21], [22]. Kou et al.[23] successfully synthesized an $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} /$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ polishing system that significantly enhances surface quality while maintaining a high removal rate. However, the high elastic modulus of the inorganic core restricts its deformability, limiting the contact area with the polishing interface and ultimately constraining the enhancement of polishing performance [24]. As a result, organic cores with narrow size distributions and low elastic moduli have garnered significant attention from researchers. During polishing, the spring effect of the core efficiently enhances the contact area between the abrasive and the workpiece. Li et al.[25] successfully synthesized a Rare-Earth ion-doped core-shell structure, $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, via a low-temperature, two-step method, exhibiting exceptional glass polishing performance with an MRR of $480.22 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ and a Ra of 0.32 nm . Nevertheless, the synthesis of organic cores may release harmful substances, and the connection between most organic cores and the surface layer is merely a simple physical attachment. Additionally, the selection of Rare-Earth ions is highly diverse. Therefore, further adoption of eco-friendly processes for organic core synthesis and optimization of rare earth ion doping strategies are critically needed.

In this work, a series of $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives doped with Rare-Earth ions $\left(\mathrm{La}^{3+}, \mathrm{Sm}^{3+}, \mathrm{Y}^{3+}, \mathrm{Yb}^{3+}\right)$ were prepared using simple hydrothermal and chemical precipitation methods. The effect of Rare-Earth ion doping on the surface chemical activity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ was explored. A comprehensive analysis was conducted to systematically discuss the correlation between the radii of Rare-Earth ions and Vo formation energy, leveraging DFT+U calculations and experimental characterizations. Additionally, a quantitative analysis was conducted to investigate the formation mechanisms of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and Vo within $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystals and to assess their impact on CMP performance. Furthermore, the CMP mechanism of core-shell abrasives was thoroughly investigated. Compared to commercial abrasives, the optimized abrasive $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ demonstrated a remarkable $66.23 \%$ reduction in the surface roughness of the polished material. This work offers novel insights for future Rare-Earth ion-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems.

## 2. Experiment

### 2.1. Materials

$D(+)$-Glucose monohydrate $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_{6} \cdot \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \geq 99.5 \%\right)$; urea (CO $\left.\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{n} \geq 99.5 \%\right)$; cerium nitrate hexahydrate $\left(\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \geq 99.5\right.$ \%), lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate $\left(\mathrm{La}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \geq 99.5 \%\right)$, samarium nitrate hexahydrate $\left(\mathrm{Sm}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \geq 99.5 \%\right)$, yttrium nitrate hexahydrate $\left(\mathrm{Y}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \geq 99.5 \%\right)$, ytterbium nitrate hexahydrate $\left(\mathrm{Yb}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \geq 99.5 \%\right)$, and deionized water. All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification.

### 2.2. Preparation of $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives

Polydisperse CS particles of various sizes were synthesized through a one-pot hydrothermal method in the presence of glucose as the carbon source, as reported in [26]. For a typical synthesis, $8-10 \mathrm{~g}$ of glucose was dissolved in 60 g of deionized (DI) water within a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. Once the glucose was completely dissolved, the autoclave was placed in a preheated oven and maintained at $180^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for up to 3 h , followed by cooling to room temperature.

The resulting dark grey suspension containing CS particles ( 50 g ) was ultrasonicated in deionized water for 10 min . Subsequently, 0.7812 g of $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, 0.07 \mathrm{~g}$ of $\mathrm{La}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, and 10.40 g of urea (dissolved in 50 g of DI water) were added. The molar ratio of $\mathrm{La} /(\mathrm{Ce}+\mathrm{La})$ in the $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ solid solution was maintained at 0.1 in this synthesis. The mixture was then slowly heated to $90^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in an oil bath and allowed to react under magnetic stirring at 300 rpm for 3 h . The product was purified through repeated ultrasonic centrifugation, washed thoroughly with DI water and ethanol, dried overnight at $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and finally calcined at $550^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in a nitrogen atmosphere for 4 h . Core-shell abrasives doped with different rare-earth ions were synthesized using an identical procedure.

### 2.3. Characterization of the abrasives

The doping element contents were measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-OES-Optima 8000.) The phase and crystal structure of all abrasives were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD, X'Pert PRO) with Cu K $\alpha$ radiation in the scan range of $20^{\circ} \sim 80^{\circ}$ at a scan rate of $2^{\circ} / \mathrm{min}$. The microstructure was analyzed by a scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100) equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system was adopted to visualize the abrasives' core-shell morphology, lattice information, and element distribution. Raman spectra were collected by using a Laser Microscopic Confocal Raman Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific DXR) with a 532 nm laser as the excitation source. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained using an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer with Al K $\alpha$ radiation ( $\mathrm{h} v=1486.6 \mathrm{eV}$ ). Chemical bonding information of the abrasives was carried out with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Avatar 670, Nicolet).

### 2.4. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation

Density functional theory (DFT) [27] calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [28]. The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method was utilized to describe the electron-ion interactions, The exchange-correlation interaction functional is treated with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [27], [29]. The electronic wave functions were expanded using plane waves with an energy cutoff of 500 eV . An effective Hubbard parameter U was used to account for the strong on-site Coulomb interactions between the localized 4 f orbitals of lanthanides, with U parameters set to 5 eV for $\mathrm{Ce} 4 \mathrm{f}$ and 5.5 eV for O 2 p states respectively [15]. The convergence for total energy and the forces between atoms were set to $10^{-5} \mathrm{eV}$ and $0.01 \mathrm{eV} \cdot \AA^{-1}$, respectively. A Gcentered Monkhorst-Pack k-point mesh with a size of $2 \times 2 \times 2$ was applied [16], [30]. The conjugate gradient algorithm was employed to fully relax all atomic positions.

Research suggests that doping two atoms and introducing an oxygen vacancy in a 1NN position, relative to the doped atoms, is the most energetically favorable scenario [31]. The model utilized in this work is

depicted in Fig. S1(a-c). The molecular compositions of the models are as follows: $\mathrm{Ce}_{32} \mathrm{O}_{64}, \mathrm{Ce}_{30} \mathrm{La}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{64}, \mathrm{Ce}_{30} \mathrm{Sm}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{64}, \mathrm{Ce}_{30} \mathrm{Y}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{64}, \mathrm{Ce}_{30} \mathrm{Yb}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{64}$, which correspond to $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{Sm}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{Y}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, respectively.

### 2.5. CMP experiment

The abrasive was dispersed through grinding, with the solid content in the slurry adjusted to $0.5 \mathrm{wt} \%$, and the pH value of the slurry was adjusted to 10.0 using a $0.1 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ solution. The quartz glass, with a nominal diameter of 20 mm and a thickness of 2 mm , was purchased from Donghai Yibo Quartz Products Co., Ltd. (China) as the polishing substrate. The commercial abrasive (simple) was purchased from Dongguan Zhongwei Grinding Technology Co., Ltd. The CMP experiments were performed on a UNIPOL-1200S automatic pressure polishing machine (China Shenyang Kejing Instrument Co., Ltd.), equipped with a polyurethane polishing pad (China Shenyang Kejing Instrument Co., Ltd.). The specific polishing parameters were as follows: the rotation speeds of the polishing disc and the sample holder plate were 60 rpm , rotating in opposite directions, the polishing load was 3.0 kg , and the polishing time was 4 min . Using the SKZD-2 dropper (China Shenyang Kejing Instrument Co., Ltd.), the roller speed was 15 rpm , and the slurry supply rate was $10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. After polishing, the samples were ultrasonically cleaned repeatedly in deionized water and ethanol, dried, and then characterized for CMP performance. The surface defects and roughness of the substrates were characterized using an atomic force microscope (AFM), operating in contact mode with a scan rate of 1.0 Hz over a $5 \mu \mathrm{~m} \times 5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ area. For evaluating the polishing efficiency, the weight loss of the polishing workpieces was measured using a precision electronic balance with an accuracy of 0.01 mg . The material removal rate (MRR) was calculated according to Eq (1) [32].
$M M R=\frac{\mathrm{m}_{0}-m}{\rho^{*} x^{*} t}$
where $\rho$ is the density of the glass, equal to $2.52 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ (measured using a glass density meter, MD-100, Beijing Xuhui Xinrui Technology Co., Ltd.), $s$ is the surface area, here $1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, $t$ is the polishing time and is the weight loss. Three parallel experiments were conducted for each polishing slurry, and the arithmetic mean value was used to represent the MRR results.

## 3. Results and discussion

### 3.1. Structural analyses of abrasives

Elemental quantification was conducted using ICP-OES, as detailed in Table 1. The measured doping concentrations closely matched the nominal value ( $10 \%$ ), indicating effective dopant control using the precipitation method. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the doped abrasives. The characteristic diffraction peaks appear at about $28.5^{\circ}$, $33^{\circ}, 47.5^{\circ}, 56.5^{\circ}, 69.5^{\circ}$, and $77.7^{\circ}$, corresponding to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (400), and (331) planes of cubic fluorite-type $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, respectively. However, the peak shapes lack sharpness, indicating low crystallinity in cerium dioxide. Diffraction peaks attributed to RareEarth oxides $\left(\mathrm{La}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}, \mathrm{Sm}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}, \mathrm{Y}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}, \mathrm{Yb}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ were difficult to discern in the doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ samples, implying effective incorporation of the doped

Rare-Earth ions into the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ matrix. Compared to pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, the (111) peak of $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{La}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Sm}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ doped samples shifted to lower angles. Conversely, the (111) peak of $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Yb}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ doped samples shifted to higher angles. The lattice parameters of the doped abrasives were determined from the broadening of the X-ray lines in the (111) diffraction using Bragg's Law Eq (2) [33] and Scherrer Eq (3) [34] equations, as shown in Table 2. The calculated lattice constants of $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{La}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Sm}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Yb}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ were approximately $5.413,5.458,5.430,5.410$, and 5.409 , respectively. The introduction of $\mathrm{La}^{3+}(103.2 \mathrm{pm})$ and $\mathrm{Sm}^{3+}(95.8 \mathrm{pm})$, with ionic radii slightly larger than $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}(92 \mathrm{pm})$, led to lattice expansion due to their larger lattice constants compared to pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. Conversely, the introduction of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}(89.9 \mathrm{pm})$ and $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}(86.8 \mathrm{pm})$, with ionic radii slightly smaller than $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, led to lattice contraction as their lattice constants were slightly smaller than that of pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The diffraction peaks of the doped samples show a noticeable shift compared with pristine $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, suggesting that $\mathrm{La}^{3+}, \mathrm{Sm}^{3+}, \mathrm{Y}^{3+}$, and $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ are doped in the lattice. No broad peak characteristic of amorphous materials (JCPDS No. 29-0085) was observed in the XRD patterns at approximately $2 \theta=22^{\circ}-23^{\circ}$, suggesting that the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanocrystals resided on the CS surface, resulting in a distinct core-shell structure.
$2 \mathrm{dsin} \theta=n \lambda$
$D=K \lambda /(\beta \mathrm{COS} \theta)$
The morphology and particle size of the samples were analyzed using SEM. SEM images clearly reveal spherical samples of varying sizes, as shown in Fig. 2. The $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ product exhibits an average particle size of approximately 230 nm . Compared to the CS core, $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives retained a spherical shape and displayed a relatively rough surface. TEM images in Fig. 3 show a contrast between the edges and centers of the abrasives, indicating a distinct core-shell structure. The contrast is attributed to the amorphous material (CS) having weaker electron beam absorption compared to $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The dense $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ shell has a thickness of approximately 12.5 to 18 nm , with a thin amorphous layer ( $1-2 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) uniformly coating the edges. The amorphous layer on the sample surface is a potential key factor for enhancing the material removal rate (MRR) [4]. EDS mapping confirms the homogeneous distribution of doped ions and the absence of a secondary phase. As shown in Fig. 3, the interplanar spacings of the (111) plane for $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{La}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Sm}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Yb}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ are 0.316 nm, 0.314 nm, 0.308 nm , and 0.314 nm , respectively, consistent with the XRD results.

FT-IR characterization of $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ was conducted to investigate its infrared absorption properties. As shown in Fig. 4, the broad absorption band at approximately $3405.1 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ is attributed to the stretching vibrations of O-H bonds (hydroxyl or carbonyl groups), as reported in [14]. The C-H stretching vibrations are observed at $2923 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ and $2852 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. The absorption bands centered at approximately 1718.2 $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ correspond to the $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ stretching vibrations of aromatic carboxyl groups $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \cdot \mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}\right)$. The absorption band at approximately $1557.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ corresponds to $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}$ stretching vibrations in the aromatic carboxylic acid region, as referenced in [26]. These functional groups form during the hydrothermal process of glucose, resulting from dehydration, decarboxylation, and aromatization reactions [35]. Peaks around 1384.6 $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}, 1128.1 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, and $1047.1 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ are likely associated with $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{C}$, indicating the formation of chemical bonds between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and CS [36], [37]. This robust interaction between the core and shell suggests stronger bonding than mere physical attachment, reducing the likelihood of shell detachment. The stretching vibrations in the range of $750-875 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ are assigned to out-of-plane bending vibrations of aromatic $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{H}$ [5]. The peak at $835 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ corresponds to bridging oxygen in $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Ce}$, and the absorption band around $490-500 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ describes the presence of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}$ stretching modes [38], [39]. The IR results are consistent with the XRD analysis.

### 3.2. Surface defect analysis

The Raman spectra of pure $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and Rare-Earth ion-doped $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids are shown in Fig. 5. The D band at $1320 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ indicates the presence of disordered graphite structures, while the G band at $1600 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ signifies ordered graphite structures. The simultaneous presence of the D and G bands confirms the successful integration of CS
with $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}[40,41]$. The typical Raman vibrational mode $\left(\mathrm{F}_{2 \mathrm{~g}}\right)$ associated with cubic fluorite-type $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ was observed only at $440-459 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, with no characteristic peaks for other rare earth oxides detected [25,40]. After Rare-Earth ion doping, the $\mathrm{F}_{2 \mathrm{~g}}$ characteristic peaks of $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9}$, $\mathrm{La}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Sm}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ shifted to lower wavenumbers compared to $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. In contrast, the $\mathrm{F}_{2 \mathrm{~g}}$ characteristic peak of $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Yb}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ shifted to higher wavenumbers. Interestingly, the $\mathrm{F}_{2 \mathrm{~g}}$ characteristic peak of $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ shifted to lower wavenumbers, likely due to the increased concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ (40). The shifts in the Raman peaks provide further evidence of successful Rare-Earth ion-doping into the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ matrix, validating the preliminary findings from XRD analysis.

The peaks at $576-587 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ correspond to structural defects in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, primarily oxygen vacancies (Vo). The intensity ratios of the peaks at $455-459 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ and $576-587 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, denoted as $\mathrm{I}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{I}_{2}$, respectively, reflect the concentration of Vo due to the presence of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ system [40]. The calculated $\mathrm{I}_{2} / \mathrm{I}_{1}$ values for $\mathrm{CeO}_{2} / \mathrm{Air}, \mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{La}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \quad \mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Sm}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \quad \mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Yb}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ are $0.08,0.11,0.13,0.12,0.21$, and 0.17 ,

respectively. Notably, samples calcined in $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ exhibit a significantly higher Vo content compared to those calcined in air, with doping further increasing the Vo content. After $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doping, the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice shows enrichment of Vo, with the highest content observed.

The shift in the $\mathrm{F}_{2 g}$ band position is influenced by defects, strain, and grain size. The oxygen vacancy concentration $\mathrm{N}\left(\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\right)$ in the samples is calculated using the correlation length $L(\mathrm{~nm})$. The defect concentration is calculated using Eq. (4)-(6) [10].
$\Gamma\left(\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\right)=5+51.8 / \mathrm{d}_{\mathrm{g}}(\mathrm{nm})$
$L(\mathrm{~nm})=\sqrt[3]{\frac{a}{2 d_{\mathrm{g}})^{2}}\left[\left(\mathrm{~d}_{\mathrm{g}}-2 \mathrm{a}\right)^{3}+4 \mathrm{~d}_{\mathrm{g}}^{2} a\right]}$
$N=3 / 4 \pi L^{3}$
Here, $\Gamma\left(\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\right)$ is the full width at half maximum (FWHM), and $\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{dg}$,
and L represent the radius of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ unit cell ( 0.34 nm ), correlation length, and grain size, respectively. The calculations show that the oxygen vacancy concentration in samples calcined in $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ is significantly higher than in those calcined in air, with $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ exhibiting the highest oxygen vacancy concentration.

In summary, our findings demonstrate that calcination in an $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ atmosphere, combined with $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doping, promotes the generation of additional surface defects ( $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and Vo), significantly enhancing tribochemical activity.

XPS spectroscopy was used to characterize the chemical bonds, surface composition, and elemental valence states of a series of $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ samples. The recorded XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 6(a)) shows the presence of $\mathrm{Ce}, \mathrm{O}$, and C , and specific peaks for $\mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Sm}, \mathrm{Y}$, and Yb were identified in the CS@Ce ${ }_{0.9} \mathrm{La}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \quad \mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Sm}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, CS@Ce ${ }_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, and CS@Ce ${ }_{0.9} \mathrm{Yb}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples, respectively. This finding further corroborates the results from EDS analysis.

The high-resolution C1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 6(b)) can be resolved into five peaks centered at $284.24,284.74,285.27,286.53$, and 288.93 eV [42]. The peaks at 288.93 and 286.53 eV correspond to $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}$ bonds. In contrast, the peaks at $285.27,284.74$, and 284.24 eV can be attributed to $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{OH}, \mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$, and $\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ bonds [14], respectively. These results can be attributed to the formation of graphitic carbon $\left(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{CH}_{4}\right)$, phenolic carbonyl $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}-\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}\right)$, carbonyl, and ester groups $(\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$, -COOR) during the carbonization process, which involves complex reactions such as dehydration (e.g., aldol condensation, esterification), decarbonylation, and aromatization.

The XPS spectra of 01 s can be deconvoluted into three distinct peaks, as shown in Fig. 6(1-p). These peaks are centered at approximately 527.8 $\mathrm{eV}, 531.3 \mathrm{eV}$, and 532.3 eV . They correspond to $\mathrm{O}^{2-}$ ions in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, lattice oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{1}\right)$, oxygen associated with Vo in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ matrix $\left(\mathrm{O}_{0}\right)$, and adsorbed oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ [15,25]. Based on peak area ratios calculated using Eq. (7), the relative content of $\mathrm{O}_{0}$ species follows this descending order: $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\mathrm{O}_{f} \%=25.39 \%\right)>\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Sm}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\mathrm{O}_{f} \%==\right.$ $21.23 \%)>\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{La}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\mathrm{O}_{f} \%=21.23 \%\right)>\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Yb}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ $\left(\mathrm{O}_{f} \%=17.36 \%\right)$. Notably, the $\mathrm{O}_{0}$ content in all these samples is higher than in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2} / \mathrm{Air}\left(\mathrm{O}_{f} \%=15.43 \%\right)$ and $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{O}_{f} \%=16.67 \%\right)$.

Fig. 6(c-h) show the Ce3d fine spectra of the samples. The Ce3d electron core level consists of two spin-orbit doublets, $3 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}$ and $3 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}$. The Ce3d core level peaks, modulated by fluctuations in the Ce4f electron states, reflect the variations between $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$. The Ce3d core level spectra were further analyzed using nonlinear peak fitting methods. The peaks corresponding to the spin-orbit $3 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}$ and $3 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}$ are labeled as u and v , respectively. The peaks labeled as $\mathrm{v}, \mathrm{v}^{\prime \prime}, \mathrm{v}^{\prime \prime \prime}, \mathrm{u}, \mathrm{u}^{\prime \prime}$, and $\mathrm{u}^{\prime \prime \prime}$ represent $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, while peaks labeled as $\mathrm{v}_{0}, \mathrm{v}^{\prime}, \mathrm{u}_{0}$, and $\mathrm{u}^{\prime}$ correspond to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. The presence of both $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ peaks across all samples indicates a mixed valence state of +3 and +4 within the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ samples. The valence state of Ce was semi-quantitatively analyzed using the peak area ratio, as described in Eq. (8) [4]. The $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration in pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives calcined in air was $24.89 \%$, and for $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives, it rose to $30.5 \%$, indicating that calcination in an $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ atmosphere enhances $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration, supporting the preliminary findings from Raman analysis. The $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentrations on the surfaces of $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{La}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \quad \mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Sm}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \quad \mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Yb}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive samples were $30.5 \%, 39.78 \%, 36.03 \%$, $46.23 \%$, and $41.2 \%$. Notably, all measured concentrations exceeded the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration of $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}(30.5 \%)$, underscoring the effectiveness of doping in enhancing the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration.

$$
\frac{\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}}{\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}+\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}}=\frac{\operatorname{area}\left(\varepsilon_{0}, \mu_{0}, \varepsilon^{\prime}, \mu^{\prime}\right)}{\text { totalarea }}
$$

Analysis of the Ce3d and O1s spectra reveals that a high $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content strongly correlates with an elevated abundance of Vo on the surface. A clear linear relationship exists between $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content and Vo content.

### 3.3. CMP performances

High-resolution surface topography and roughness within a $5 \times 5$ $\mu \mathrm{m}^{2}$ area, along with cross-sectional line-scan profiles (SR) of wafers before and after abrasive polishing, were analyzed using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). The limited scan rate of AFM confines the
acquisition of high-resolution images to small areas, typically $-5 \times 5$ $\mu \mathrm{m}^{2}$. To reduce variability in polishing outcomes, three random measurement locations were selected on the polished plane of each sample, and their results were averaged. Profile measurements were taken diagonally across the 2D-AFM height images for comparison, while 3DAFM slope images were used to visualize surface morphology changes resulting from CMP. The 2D-AFM height image before polishing is shown in Fig. 8(a). The average Ra and RMS values were 1.619 nm and 2.836 nm . After CMP treatment with the abrasives, numerous nanoscale sharp peaks were effectively eliminated compared to the original surface. Additionally, the developed $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and Rare-Earth ion-doped $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives (Fig. 8(b, d-g)) exhibited superior flatness in the polished planes, surpassing commercial precision polishing abrasives (Fig. 8(c)). The values of Ra, RMS, SR, and MRR for $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{La}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \quad \mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Sm}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \quad \mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \quad \mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Yb}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ are shown in Fig. 7. Compared to commercial abrasives, the Ra values for $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and those doped with $\mathrm{La}^{3+}, \mathrm{Sm}^{3+}, \mathrm{Y}^{3+}$, and $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ were reduced by $44.1 \%, 41.5 \%, 46.7 \%, 66.23 \%$, and 45.45 $\%$. The SR values were reduced by $51.9 \%, 88.2 \%, 65.42 \%, 82.89 \%$, and $82.04 \%$. The RMS values (micro-roughness) were reduced by $40 \%$, $55.7 \%, 50.7 \%, 74.2 \%$, and $52.8 \%$, indicating a significant improvement in polishing quality with Rare-Earth element-doped. Among the Rare-Earth element-doped abrasives, $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ exhibited the smallest Ra, RMS, and SR values, as well as the highest MRR value ( $221.04 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ). These results confirm that the developed $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and Rare-Earth element-doped $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives can reduce surface roughness and achieve planarization at the nanoscale, demonstrating potential applications in precision polishing fields such as semiconductors.

### 3.4. DFT analysis

The formation of oxygen vacancies in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is accompanied by the reduction of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, a process closely linked to its polishing

performance. Therefore, understanding the ease of oxygen vacancy formation in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is crucial. The impact of dopants on the formation energy of oxygen vacancies is influenced by factors such as the dopant ion's coordination number, structural relaxation, and coordination type [43-45]. In this work all dopant elements are in the " +3 valence" state, and the optimal coordination type is used to minimize the influence of coordination number and configuration.

The compensated vacancy formation energy ( $\mathrm{E}_{\text {vac }}$ ) and active oxygen vacancy formation energy ( $\Delta \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{A}}$ ) of doped and undoped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems were analyzed and calculated using Eq. (9) [16] and Eq. (10) [17]. $\mathrm{E}_{\text {cell }}$. vac represents the total energy of the supercell containing oxygen vacancies, while $\mathrm{E}_{\text {cell }}$ corresponds to the total energy of the supercell without oxygen vacancies. Additionally, $\mu_{0}$ represents the total energy of a free $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecule in its ground state. $\mathrm{E}_{\text {(RE-doped-A) }}$ denotes the energy of the doped system containing two oxygen vacancies.
$E_{\text {vac }}=E_{\text {cell-vac }}+\mu_{0}-E_{\text {cell }}$
$\Delta \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{A}}=E_{\text {RE-doped } - \mathrm{A}}+\mu_{0}-E_{\text {cell-vac }}$
As shown in Table 3, the $\mathrm{E}_{\text {vac }}$ values for the Rare-Earth ion-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems are negative, indicating that the formation of compensating oxygen vacancies under $\mathrm{La}^{3+}, \mathrm{Sm}^{3+}, \mathrm{Y}^{3+}$, and $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ doping releases energy, benefiting the overall system. Among the doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems, $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ exhibits the lowest Evac, suggesting that, at equivalent doping concentrations, it forms the highest number of compensating oxygen vacancies. The $\Delta \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{A}}$ values for $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems doped with $\mathrm{La}^{3+}, \mathrm{Sm}^{3+}, \mathrm{Y}^{3+}$, and $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ are all positive, indicating that energy absorption is needed to form active oxygen vacancies.

| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ | -521.53 | -516.92 | -513.08 | 3.275 | 2.505 |
| $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ | -518.51 | -518.07 | -513.91 | -0.895 | 2.825 |
| $\mathrm{Sn}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ | -518.16 | -517.74 | -513.56 | -0.915 | 2.845 |
| $\mathrm{Y}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ | -522.08 | -521.97 | -517.95 | -1.225 | 2.685 |
| $\mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ | -518.54 | -518.27 | -514.40 | -1.065 | 2.535 |

Additionally, the formation energy of active oxygen vacancies in the doped systems is higher than in the undoped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ system. This suggests that doping with $\mathrm{La}^{3+}, \mathrm{Sm}^{3+}, \mathrm{Y}^{3+}$, and $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ negatively impacts the reduction of $\Delta \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{A}}$.

In the ideal $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ structure, the electronic states near the Fermi level are mainly divided into two regions: the valence band (approximately 5 eV to 0 eV ) and the conduction band ( 0 eV to 5 eV ). Fig. 9(a) shows the partial density of states (PDOS) for the ideal $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ structure. The Fig. 9 (a) clearly shows that the electronic states in the valence band are primarily composed of O 2 p orbitals, with some hybridization with Ce 5 d and Ce 4 f orbitals, resulting in a calculated bandgap of approximately 3.94 eV . The electronic states in the conduction band are primarily composed of unoccupied Ce 4 f orbitals. These unoccupied Ce 4 f orbitals are what give $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ its unique electron storage capability. A bandgap of approximately 2.46 eV is observed between the O 2 p states and Ce 4 f states, consistent with findings reported in the literature [15,16,31]. Comparing the density of states (DOS) of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ before and after introducing oxygen vacancies (Fig. 9(b)) reveals the emergence of localized electronic states near the Fermi level. This occurs because the formation of an oxygen vacancy leaves behind two free electrons, which then occupy the vacant Ce 4 f orbitals. Compared to the unreduced system, the DOS of the reduced system shifts to lower energy levels. This shift may be due to the localized states introduced by oxygen vacancies, located below the conduction band minimum (CBM). As a result, the electronic state density in this energy region increases, shifting the overall DOS curve to lower energies. These new states create intra-gap states near the Fermi level, narrowing the bandgap and enhancing electron transfer efficiency [46].

Comparing the DOS before and after rare-earth ion doping (Fig. 9(cd)) shows that the bandgap of the doped system narrows (to 2.1 eV ) compared to the undoped system. This bandgap reduction may result from hybridization between the dopant elements' orbitals and the Ce 4 f or O 2 p orbitals in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, shifting the conduction band minimum or valence band maximum towards the Fermi level. Additionally, lattice distortions and strain induced by doping may alter atomic interactions, further affecting the electronic band structure and resulting in a narrower bandgap. Fig. 9(c-d) also show that even without oxygen

vacancies, the doped systems introduce mid-gap states near the Fermi level, mainly as unoccupied states below the CBM. The appearance of these mid-gap states may be due to differences in coordination numbers between $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ and the dopant ions in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ matrix. However, introducing oxygen vacancies into the doped systems causes these midgap states to disappear. Although oxygen vacancies usually introduce two additional electrons, the DOS in Fig. 9(c-d) does not show localized states corresponding to these vacancies. Moreover, the projected density of states (PDOS) of the rare-earth ions shows no significant changes before and after introducing oxygen vacancies, indicating that the two electrons left by the vacancies do not transfer to the dopant ions or localize on the Ce 4 f orbitals. Instead, they likely compensate for the hole states created by doping. Fig. 9(c-d) show that the DOS of the doped system with oxygen vacancies shifts slightly to lower energy levels compared to the system without vacancies. This slight shift may result from the formation of oxygen vacancies, leading to hybridization of the mid-gap states with the original conduction band states, thus creating new low-energy electronic states. However, the overall DOS of the doped system shows no significant changes, suggesting that it can accommodate oxygen vacancies while maintaining a relatively stable electronic structure. This suggests that changes in the electronic structure are not the primary factor driving the significant reduction in oxygen vacancy formation energy; instead, energetically favorable lattice distortions are likely the main contributors.

To investigate how structural distortions affect oxygen vacancy formation energy, the first step is to assess the impact of volume strain. The relationships between $\mathrm{E}_{\text {vac }}, \Delta \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{A}}$, and volume strain after adding oxygen vacancies to the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ supercell are plotted in Fig. 10(b). For compensated oxygen vacancies, $\mathrm{E}_{\text {vac }}$ shows a positive correlation with volume, highlighting the critical role of volume strain. Additionally, an ionic radius closer to $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ results in less volume change. For active oxygen vacancies, except for $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, a smaller ionic radius results in less volume change and lower $\Delta \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{A}}$. The formation enthalpy and bond lengths of the oxides are calculated and presented in Fig. 10(c). These parameters significantly impact the interactions between dopant ions and surrounding oxygen atoms. We found that $\Delta \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{A}}$ is proportional to the bond lengths and formation enthalpy $\left(\Delta \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$ of the oxides [47]. Notably,
the bond lengths and formation enthalpy of oxides indicate the bonding ability of elements with oxygen. When an oxygen vacancy appears at a 1 NN position, it significantly affects the oxygen vacancy formation energy. Fig. 10(d) shows that introducing compensated oxygen vacancies causes structural relaxation, leading to corresponding energy changes. Compared to the 4.09 eV energy change in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, introducing oxygen vacancies in $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{Sm}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{Y}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ results in additional energy changes of $0.44 \mathrm{eV}, 0.58 \mathrm{eV}, 0.11 \mathrm{eV}$, and 0.27 eV , respectively, indicating a substantial reduction. As the ionic radius approaches $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, the energy change decreases. As the ionic radius approaches $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, the energy change decreases.

In summary, compared to the undoped system, doping reduces structural distortions and energy fluctuations caused by oxygen vacancies. For compensated oxygen vacancies, $\mathrm{E}_{\text {vac }}$ decreases as the ionic radius approaches $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, with the $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$-doped system showing the lowest $\mathrm{E}_{\text {vac. }}$. For active oxygen vacancies, $\Delta \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{A}}$ decreases as the ionic radius decreases, with the $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$-doped system showing the lowest $\Delta \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{A}}$. This is likely because the influence of Rare-Earth ions with identical coordination numbers on $\mathrm{E}_{\text {vac }}$ primarily stems from structural distortions. Volume strain and lattice relaxation are correlated with ionic radius, where radii significantly deviating from $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ typically result in larger geometric distortions. The lower $\mathrm{E}_{\text {vac }}$ of $\mathrm{Y}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ could be due to its proximity to the $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ radius, minimizing changes to the crystal structure upon doping and oxygen vacancy creation. The primary variations in $\Delta \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{A}}$ energy stem from the interactions between dopant atoms and their neighboring oxygen atoms. The reduced $\Delta \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{f}}$ and shorter bond lengths of $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ weaken its attraction to surrounding oxygen atoms, facilitating their egress from the crystal. The absence of significant crystal structure changes upon forming active oxygen vacancies likely accounts for the reduced $\Delta \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{A}}$ of $\mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$.

An overall characterization reveals a correlation between the trends in oxygen vacancy concentration, $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration, and the changes in compensated oxygen vacancy formation energy. This suggests that compensated oxygen vacancies play a dominant role in the doped systems. Furthermore, the concentrations of oxygen vacancies and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ are related to the ionic radius. The formation energy of compensated oxygen vacancies decreases as the ionic radius approaches $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$. Consequently,

The unique localization of Ce 4 f orbitals (shown in Fig. 11(e)) facilitates the storage of free electrons within $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ system. As a result, oxygen vacancies and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ are formed in the ceria lattice. However, forming active oxygen vacancies is challenging, significantly hindering the increase in $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration. High concentrations of oxygen vacancies can still be achieved in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ system through doping strategies. Trivalent $\mathrm{RE}^{3+}$ ions, as shown in Fig. 11(a), are introduced into the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice to replace higher-valent $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ions. To maintain charge balance and structural stability, lattice oxygen escapes as $\mathrm{O}_{5}$, as shown in Fig. 11(b). This process creates oxygen vacancies and releases two free electrons to maintain charge neutrality. The electrons are captured by $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ions surrounding the oxygen vacancies, as shown in Fig. 11(c), leading to the reduction of their oxidation state. As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), the electrons are not permanently bound to any specific $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ion to reduce its oxidation state to +3 , but move around the vacancy under the influence of the electric field. This suggests that under certain stimuli, the electrons stored in $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ can migrate to other locations and participate in reactions.

### 3.6. CMP mechanism

During the polishing process, the abrasives primarily undergo sliding and rolling motions between the substrate and the polishing pad. Polyhedral abrasives mainly rely on sliding to remove excess material, but rolling, which inevitably occurs during polishing, can cause secondary damage to the substrate due to their sharp edges. In contrast, spherical particles, due to their rounded shape, lack sharp edges and thus effectively prevent secondary damage. Moreover, spherical particles exhibit a significantly lower friction coefficient with flat substrates compared to polyhedral abrasives. As a result, spherical abrasives with low friction coefficients can effortlessly reach the top regions of crystal planes and rectangular edges, thereby enhancing polishing efficiency and debris removal.

As mentioned earlier, core-shell abrasives can effectively address the morphology issue. However, the benefits of core-shell abrasives go beyond this, offering additional advantages. Incorporating an organic core with a low elastic modulus leads to a spring-like behavior under pressure, minimizing contact stress and indentation depth while maximizing particle-surface contact area (Fig. 12(a)). Consequently, scratches from sliding friction are reduced, leading to improved surface quality and fewer defects [48]. Compared to commercial abrasives, core-shell abrasives exhibit smaller contact angles, resulting in superior interfacial wettability and enhanced chemical reactions at the solid--liquid interface (Fig.52.) [49]. Studies show a direct correlation between shell thickness and polishing amount, while surface roughness

inversely correlates with shell thickness [50]. A shell thickness of 12-20 nm optimizes both polishing amount and quality, facilitating smaller and more uniform contact stress on the wafer surface while minimizing the risk of brittle fracture in the inorganic shell. The core-shell abrasives synthesized in this work have a surface shell thickness of $12.5-18 \mathrm{~nm}$, effectively preventing shell fracture and preserving polishing quality. Additionally, the core-shell structure efficiently preserves $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, resisting sedimentation and agglomeration in the polishing slurry, thus
enhancing abrasive utilization and simplifying post-polishing waste management.

Fig.12. Illustrates the polishing characteristics of $\mathrm{cs} @ \mathrm{ceo}_{2}$ abrasives. The polishing characteristics of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives adhere to Cook's chemical tooth theory. Amphoteric oxides $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ undergo hydration in the slurry [51]. As shown in Fig. 12(b), the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate surface hydrolyzes into hydrogen-terminated -Si-OH species, referred to as the "soft layer," within the slurry. Under the downward pressure

exerted by the polishing machine, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ in the slurry undergoes surface hydration, leading to the formation of Ce-OH. Upon contact with the glass surface, as shown in Fig. 12(d), Ce-OH on the abrasive surface forms Ce-O-Si bonds with the Si-OH soft layer on the glass surface. Free electrons from $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ migrate to the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surface, entering the antibonding orbitals of the Si-O bonds, weakening and breaking them. Mechanical stress facilitates Si-O bond breaking, resulting in the removal of excess material from the surface. Furthermore, Fig. 12(c) shows that $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ catalyzes and accelerates the chemical reaction between the glass surface and water molecules during polishing. Under the downward pressure exerted by the polishing machine, water molecules interact with $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions to soften the silica surface. As Si-O bonds break, water molecules dissociate at the weakened bonds, introducing OH groups to the glass surface [52]. This process creates a softened layer on the glass surface, enabling the subsequent round of polishing. The chemical bond breakage resulting from the interaction between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ significantly enhances the removal of excess material during polishing. Consequently, surface quality is significantly improved.

## 4. Conclusion

This work introduces a novel abrasive design concept for planarizing glass surfaces. A simple, low-temperature, and controllable two-step method was used to synthesize approximately 230 nm $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{~N} \mathrm{E}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives. SEM and TEM analyses revealed a thin, uniform $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ layer coating polydisperse carbon spheres (CS) synthesized via a hydrothermal method, exhibiting a characteristic core-shell structure. FT-IR confirmed that $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is firmly bonded to the carbon spheres, forming strong chemical bonds. EDS, XRD, and Raman analyses confirmed the successful doping of $\mathrm{La}^{3+}, \mathrm{Sm}^{3+}, \mathrm{Y}^{3+}$, and $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ into the $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ structure. Raman and XPS results show that doping with rare earth elements increases the surface concentrations of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancies $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}\right)$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, thereby enhancing tribochemical activity. During the CMP process, $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives exhibited excellent performance metrics ( $\mathrm{Ra}=0.236 \mathrm{~nm}, \mathrm{RMS}=0.361 \mathrm{~nm}, \mathrm{SR}=1.419 \mathrm{~nm}$, MRR=253.2 nm/min). This superior performance is attributed to enhanced tribochemical activity, which accelerates the removal of the chemically modified layer. DFT+U calculations revealed that in doped systems, oxygen vacancies in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ are predominantly compensatory. The concentration of oxygen vacancies and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ is strongly correlated with the radius of the dopant ions. The closer the ion radius is to that of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, the lower the energy required to form compensatory oxygen vacancies. Consequently, the concentration of oxygen vacancies and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ increases. This work provides a valuable reference for optimizing Rare-Earth-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ CMP abrasives. It thoroughly explores the correlation between the radius of doped Rare-Earth ions and their impact on polishing performance. The findings indicate that $\mathrm{CS} @ \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ exhibits excellent abrasive properties, making it a suitable candidate for highperformance CMP applications.
