#### Abstract

As the demand for advanced optical glass technology increases, improving polishing slurries to enhance material removal rate and reduce surface roughness has become a priority. Cerium oxide is the most widely used abrasive for glass polishing, and its polishing rate is regarded to increase as the surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content rises. To improve this, $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$-doped cerium oxide was prepared using a molten salt method. Morphological and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses showed that the $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ doping increased $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content and transformed the particles into an octahedral structure. Additionally, $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ doping enhanced the mechanical action, as evidenced by an increased friction coefficient and reduced contact angle. When the doping amount is $4 \%, \mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content and material removal rate peaked at $47.87 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$, while the doping amount is $8 \%$, mechanical and chemical synergy achieved the lowest surface roughness of 1.38 nm .

## 1 Introduction

Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) technology's development stems from the need for higher surface flatness and smoothness in shrinking semiconductor sizes, smooth transitions between layers in multilayer integrated circuits, and the removal of defects and contaminants to meet stringent surface quality requirements. As integrated circuit sizes shrink, achieving precise planarization becomes essential to reduce defects and optimize the performance of the devices. CMP enables the production of smaller, more complex devices with higher packing densities and improved functionality. These factors collectively drive the advancement of CMP technology

[^0]in semiconductor manufacturing [1-3]. CMP is a sophisticated technique that achieves precise surface flatness by concurrently considering local and global material aspects [4]. The process combines mechanical abrasion and chemical reactions, with the polishing slurry playing a critical role in influencing material removal rates, surface finishes, and preventing damage to delicate semiconductor structures. The polishing slurry playing a key role in influencing performance and efficiency [5]. The continued advancement of CMP technology is crucial for ensuring the performance and reliability of semiconductor devices, contributing to the development of more powerful and energy-efficient devices.

In these slurries, abrasives exert both mechanical and chemical effects on the workpiece, thereby directly influencing the outcomes of the CMP process [5-7]. $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ has moderate hardness and good mechanical action, while it has chemical tooth effect and significant chemical activity [8], which make it widely suitable for chemical mechanical polishing in various products including optical glass [9].

states and readily switch between them facilitates complexing of SiO_{2}, solidifying CeO_{2} as an effective polishing abrasives [10]. Sabia and Stevens discovered that during the polishing process, both Ce ${ }^{4+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ were present on the surface of CeO_{2} abrasive particles [11]. Xu et al. demonstrated that enhancing the ratio of Ce ${ }^{3+}$ could improve the CeO_{2} abrasives' polishing efficiency [12]. Schmidt et al. found that trivalent ion doping enhances $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ formation on CeO2 crystals [13]. Similarly, Patil et al. found that trivalent ion doping creates many oxygen vacancies in CeO2 without altering its structure [14]. Cheng et al. experimented with lanthanide doping (La, Nd, Yb) on commercial CeO2 abrasives, resulting in a notable enhancement in the abrasives' polishing efficiency on SiO2 matrices [15]. Jin et al. reported a significant increase in the polishing efficiency of CeO2 abrasives with high Nd ${ }^{3+}$ doping, showing a 3.62 -fold higher rate compared to pure CeO2 [16]. These studies have confirmed the potential of $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ doping to enhance MRR.

However, Cheng and Jin et al. utilized surface immersion and hydrothermal methods for doping, which are commonly used in the synthesis of CeO2. While the salt melting method has been applied in various contexts, its specific advantages for CeO2 synthesis were further demonstrated by Xia's research [17], which showed that $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ prepared using the crucible-based salt melting method exhibited a higher $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration. The salt melting method has gained significant attention for its environmentally friendly nature, cost-effectiveness, simplicity, and scalability in producing nanomaterials with diverse chemical compositions and morphologies. This technique employs molten salts as a reaction medium to facilitate the dissolution and recrystallization of precursors at elevated temperatures, allowing precise control over particle size and morphology under moderate reaction conditions. In the case of CeO2 synthesis, salt melting method offers distinct advantages over the hydrothermal method. Unlike the latter, salt melting method operates at lower internal pressures during the reaction, reducing the likelihood of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ oxidation by oxygen and water vapor. This results in a higher surface concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, a factor that significantly enhances the material's properties and contributes to improved MRR, as confirmed by Xia's findings. Additionally, Ma et al. investigated Y$^{3+}, \mathrm{La}^{3+}$, and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ doping of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ by the salt melting method and found that $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doped CeO2 exhibited the highest $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration and MRR [18]. Furthermore, Xu et al. enhanced MRR by preparing $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doped $\mathrm{Ce}_{\mathrm{L-x}} \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ particles and polishing quartz glass under photocatalysis [19]. These studies have conducted extensive research on the synthesis of cerium oxide and provided a detailed explanation of its chemical mechanisms. However, chemical mechanical polishing involves not only chemical interactions but also significant mechanical actions and the wetting effects of the polishing slurry. These aspects were not addressed in the previous research by Ma and Xu et al. Specifically, their conclusions regarding the mechanical actions lack a solid theoretical foundation. Therefore, further testing of its mechanical properties is required.

In this work, the abrasives $\mathrm{Ce}_{\mathrm{L-x}} \mathrm{Nd}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ with different doping amounts were synthesized using the molten salt method (x is the doping amount of $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, $\mathrm{x}=0.00,0.02,0.04,0.06,0.08,0.10$ ). The chemical and mechanical effects of CMP were investigated, and a mechanism for CMP was proposed.

## 2 Experimental and methods

### 2.1 Preparation of $\mathrm{Ce}_{\mathrm{L}_{x}} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives

The abrasives $\mathrm{Ce}_{\mathrm{L-x}} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ with different doping amounts were synthesized using the molten salt method [18] (x is the doping amount of $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{x}=0.00,0.02,0.04$, $0.06,0.08,0.10$ ). However, it is worth noting that the reaction temperature was optimized ( $800^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) to ensure that the particle size remained in a suitable range.

### 2.2 Characterization of the abrasives and polishing slurry

The descriptions of the characterization details are reported in the supporting information (S1).

### 2.3 CMP experiment

The preparation method for the CMP polishing slurry is as follows: adding the abrasive to deionized water $(\mathrm{PH}=10)$, dispersing it with ultrasonic waves for 10 min , stirring with a magnetic agitator for 5 min , and then conducting the CMP test. The experimental details are shown in Table 1.

After polishing, MRR is calculated by Eq. (1) [18, 20]:

## 3 Results and discussions

### 3.1 Phase and morphology analysis

The XRD pattern of Ce_{0.9}Nd_{0.1}O_{2} abrasive and CeO_{2} abrasive are shown in Fig. 1. The diffraction peaks of CeO_{2} are located at 2θ values of approximately 28.6°, 33.2°, 47.6°, 56.4°, 59.2°, 69.5°, 76.7°, and 79.1°. These peaks correspond to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331), and (420) planes of the CeO_{2} phase, as referenced in PDF#04--002-3313. For Ce_{0.9}Nd_{0.1}O_{2}, the diffraction peaks are observed at 2θ values around 28.5°, 33.1°, 47.5°, 56.3°, 59.1°, 69.4°, 76.7°, and 79.1°, which are also associated with the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331), and (420) planes of the CeO_{2} phase, according to the same reference. Comparing the diffraction peaks of Ce_{0.9}Nd_{0.1}O_{2} with CeO_{2}, it is evident that Nd^{3+} doping does not notably shift the overall peak positions of cerium oxide, confirming that it remains in the cerium oxide phase without the appearance of impurity peaks related to Nd, thus confirming the successful doping. In
the XRD pattern of Ce_{0.9}Nd_{0.1}O_{2,} the larger radius of Nd ${ }^{3+}$ (99.5 pm) compared to Ce ${ }^{4+}(92 \mathrm{pm})$ [21] causes lattice expansion in CeO $_{2}$, resulting in a peak shift [18] towards lower angles.
The shape and size of abrasives significantly impact the mechanical effectiveness in CMP processes. Figure 2(a)-(f) displays SEM images of CeO_{2} abrasive and Ce $_{1-\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{Nd}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the CeO ${ }_{2}$ abrasive particles have a polyhedral shape with an average size of 534 nm . In contrast, Fig. 2(b)-(g) illustrate that the particle size of Ce $_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive is all smaller than CeO $_{2}$, and the particle size decreases with increasing of Nd ${ }^{3+}$ doping levels. As the particle size decreases, the depth to which the abrasive penetrates the substrate material during the polishing process is reduced, leading to a decrease in the mechanical action. Alternatively, the shape of Ce $_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives transitions from polyhedral to octahedral as the Nd ${ }^{3+}$ doping increases, maintaining a primarily octahedral structure when the doping level reaches 4%. The octahedral shape, with its sharper edges compared to those of polyhedral shapes, generates greater point pressure during the polishing process, thereby increasing the material removal rate from the substrate. Figure 3 (a)-(b) shows the EDS spectra of CeO2 abrasive and Ce $_{0.9} \mathrm{Nd}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive. Only Ce and O elements exist in the EDS results of CeO 2 abrasive, while Ce , O and Nd elements exist in Ce $_{0.9} \mathrm{Nd}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives, which also confirms the success of Nd ${ }^{3+}$ doping [18].
The zeta potential method measures system stability [22], a higher absolute zeta potential implies increased repulsive forces between particles, leading to greater

stability. Generally, a zeta potential above 30 mV indicates a more stable suspension [23]. Figure 2(h) shows that the zeta potential of polishing slurry prepared by $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive is -31.2 mV , indicating that the polishing
slurry made from $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ prepared by this method is relatively stable. Furthermore, the absolute zeta potential of the polishing slurries prepared with doped $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives is higher than $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive. This indicates

that $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ doping enhances the stability of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives polishing slurries. When the doping amount is $4 \%$, the absolute zeta potential is at its highest, suggesting that the polishing slurry exhibits the greatest stability.

### 3.2 Surface defect analysis

Figure 4(a) presents the XPS spectrum of the CeO2 abrasive and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives. The spectrum for $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive reveals the presence of only Ce and O elements, with no detectable $\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{Na}, \mathrm{Cl}$, or Nd elements. Conversely, the spectrum for $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives reveals the presence of Ce, Nd, and O elements, but no $\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{Na}$, or Cl elements. The absence of detectable $\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{Na}, \mathrm{Cl}$ elements in both the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives indicating that no residual salts are present on the surface. Additionally, peaks observed in the $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives spectrum at 982.3 eV and 1005.8 eV correspond to $\mathrm{Nd} 3 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}$ and $\mathrm{Nd} 3 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}$, respectively. The results confirm $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ ions are located at the surface of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives. Combined with XRD and EDS results, it is evident that $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ ions are successfully doped in the $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives.

As $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ is a key factor in the polishing process of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces, The Ce 3d characteristic spectrum is analyzed, with the spin-orbitals $3 \mathrm{~d}_{5} / 2$ and $3 \mathrm{~d}_{3} / 2$ represented by the symbols "v" and "u," respectively. The peaks corresponding to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ are marked as $\mathrm{v}_{6}, \mathrm{v}, \mathrm{u}_{6}$, and $\mathrm{u} \mathrm{\prime}$, whereas the peaks for $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ are labeled $\mathrm{v}, \mathrm{v}^{\prime}, \mathrm{v}^{\prime \prime}, \mathrm{u}, \mathrm{u}^{\prime \prime}$, and $\mathrm{u}^{\prime \prime \prime}$ [19]. The final XPS fitting results are shown in Fig. 4(b)-(g), with more detailed peak area data and binding energies provided in Table 2. The $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives was calculated using Eqs. (2)(4), and the results are shown in Fig. 4(h). The findings indicate that the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive surface is only $22.51 \%$, while the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive surface is higher. Specifically, the $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Nd}_{0.04} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive surface exhibited the highest $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration, at $37.68 \%$.

\end{aligned}
$$

Additionally, the oxygen vacancy content on $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive was found to correlate positively with the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content. The O 1 s characteristic spectrum was examined, as shown in Fig. 5(a)-(f). The peaks at 529 eV, 531 eV , and 533 eV correspond to lattice oxygen (Oa),

surface oxygen (Oß), and adsorbed oxygen (O $\gamma$ ), respectively [24]. Here, $\mathrm{O} \beta$ represents the oxygen vacancy present in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive, which can be calculated by Eq. (5). Calculated oxygen vacancy concentration of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive surface are shown in Fig. 5(g). The results show that the oxygen vacancy concentration on the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive surface is $34.44 \%$, whereas it is higher on the $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive surface. Specifically, the $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Nd}_{0.04} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive surface exhibits the highest surface oxygen vacancy concentration (45.20\%). This indicates that more $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ is reduced to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in the $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ crystal, aligning with the calculated $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration.

$$
\mathrm{C}(\text { oxygen vacancy })=\mathrm{O} \beta /(\mathrm{O} \alpha+\mathrm{O} \beta+\mathrm{O} \gamma)
$$

Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy was employed to further verify the presence of oxygen vacancies on $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives. As depicted in Fig. 6. The peak around $460 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ represents the F2g vibration mode of cubic $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ [25], while the peak at $600 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ indicates dopingrelated structural defects [21]; the ratio of these peak intensities (I600/I460) reflects the concentration of oxygen vacancies in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ [26], as shown in Eq. (6):

$$
\mathrm{C}(\text { oxygen vacancy })=(1600 / 1460)
$$

The oxygen vacancy concentration is $0.58 \%$ for $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives and higher for $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives, with $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Nd}_{0.04} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ showing the highest at $3.39 \%$. This indicates more $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ is reduced to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, consistent with both XPS and Raman spectroscopy results.

### 3.3 Contact angle analysis

The effect of $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ doping on the surface hydrophilicity of polishing slurries prepared with $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives was further investigated. Static contact angles between polishing slurries prepared by $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives and glass substrates were measured by a contact angle measurement instrument, as shown in Fig. 7. The contact angle between pure water and the glass substrate is $48.3^{\circ}$. However, the contact angle between the polishing slurries and the glass substrate decreases with the addition of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives. The minimum contact angle observed was $22.6^{\circ}$, which was obtained with polishing slurries prepared by $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Nd}_{0.04} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive. These results indicate that $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ doping can improve the hydrophilicity of polishing slurries prepared by $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives. When the doping amount is $4 \%$, the contact angle reaches its minimum. This matches the XPS results, showing that the higher $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration on the $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ improves bonding with the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ in the glass substrate. Therefore, it is

reflected at the macro level that the polishing slurries exhibits lower contact angle performance. In the CMP process, the contact angle between the slurry and the glass substrate plays a key role in both the chemical and mechanical actions of the polishing process. A smaller contact angle leads to a higher diffusion coefficient of the slurry on the glass surface, increasing the contact area. Consequently, a reduced contact angle allows the effective substances in the slurry to diffuse more efficiently to the glass surface during polishing, enhancing the chemical reaction at the interface and may improving the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ removal rate [27]. Additionally, a smaller contact angle increases the mechanical interaction by enlarging the contact area, thereby enhancing the abrasion effect. Conversely, if the contact angle between the polishing liquid and the glass substrate increases, it would reduce the diffusion of active substances to the wafer surface and decrease the contact area, thereby diminishing both the chemical reaction and the mechanical abrasion efficiency, ultimately may lowering the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ removal rate. This offers a more intuitive understanding of the mechanical behavior of doped cerium oxide polishing slurry.

### 3.4 Friction coefficient

In the CMP process, mechanical action is crucial for material removal. It relies on both chemical reactions and mechanical wear. Greater mechanical forces lead to increased contact pressure, enhancing the abrasive particles' wear effect on the material surface [28]. A higher
coefficient of friction results in greater friction under the same normal force. This increased friction enhances the scraping and cutting actions of the abrasive particles on the material surface, thereby improving wear efficiency. Consequently, more material can be removed per unit time. The dynamic friction coefficient (COF) of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{Nd}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives was measured using a friction coefficient meter. According to Fig. 8, pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ has the lowest average COF at 0.37 . In contrast, the COF of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{Nd}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives doped with $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ is higher. Notably, when the $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ doping amount is $4 \%$, the dynamic COF reaches its maximum value of 0.42 . This may be due to the improved adhesion between the polishing particles and the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ in the glass substrate. More bonding leads to increased polishing resistance. This is also consistent with XPS and contact angle changes. When the doping amount is $4 \%$, the abrasive particles have the highest surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration, allowing for better bonding with the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$. Simultaneously, the polishing particles achieve greater contact with the glass substrate, facilitating increased bonding between abrasive and the substrate. Consequently, polishing resistance and the COF increase. However, in the previous XPS analysis, with $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ doping at $6 \%$, the surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content was found to be less than $4 \%$. Interestingly, despite both samples exhibiting an octahedral morphology, the COF remained identical to that of the $4 \%$ doping level. The primary distinction lay in the size of the abrasives: 400 nm for the $4 \%$ doping and 348 nm for the $6 \%$ doping. This observation suggests that

at an abrasive size of 348 nm , there is improved contact between the abrasive particles and the glass substrate, which compensates for the lower $\mathrm{Ce}^{3}+$ content and enhances their adhesion. This underscores the critical role of particle size in mechanical interactions.

### 3.5 Material removal rate (MRR) analysis

Improved material removal rates contribute to saving processing time and reducing abrasive costs. Therefore, achieving high material removal rates is a common goal in the industry [29]. Figure 9 shows that the MRR for glass substrates polished with $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives ranges from 35.99 to $47.87 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$, significantly higher than the $28.18 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives. $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ doping improves polishing efficiency, with $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Nd}_{0.04} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ showing the highest MRR, $69.88 \%$ greater than pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. This enhancement is due to better bonding between the
abrasive and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and the effective mechanical action of larger, polyhedral particles when doping is under $4 \%$. However, the MRR does not peak due to low chemical activity. At low doping levels, the abrasive's chemical activity is the primary factor affecting MRR. Reduced chemical activity limits bonding between abrasive particles and the glass substrate, resulting in inadequate $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ removal and a lower MRR.

When the doping amount is $4 \%$, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration on the surface of the abrasive reaches its highest level, resulting in the strongest chemical interaction during the polishing process. This enhances the formation of chemical bonds between the abrasive particles and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$, allowing for more efficient removal of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ fragments from the substrate material. At this doping level, the morphology of the abrasives transitions to an octahedral shape, which further enhances the mechanical action during polishing.

Fig. 9 Curve of material removal rate with doping amount

The octahedral particles, with sharper edges compared to the polyhedral shape, generate higher localized pressure on the substrate when subjected to the same external force. This increased pressure facilitates the detachment of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ fragments from the substrate surface. Although the reduction in particle size due to doping leads to a decrease in the mechanical action and the depth of
particle penetration into the substrate, the overall material removal rate is highest at a doping amount of $4 \%$. However, when the doping amount exceeds $4 \%$, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration of the particles begins to decrease, leading to a reduction in chemical action. Although the abrasives have stabilized into an octahedral shape with good mechanical effect, the abrasive size is reduced, causing

some abrasives to become embedded in the polishing pad, thereby diminishing their effective polishing capability. Especially When doping reaches $8 \%$ or $10 \%$, although the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration of the abrasive is higher than at $2 \%$, the MRR decreases. This is due to the reduced particle size, which weakens the bonding between the abrasive particles and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and diminishes mechanical action, leading to a lower MRR.

### 3.6 Surface quality analysis of polished and unpolished glass substrates

Surface roughness is a key factor influencing both the functional performance and the overall quality of a glass substrate. For instance, in applications involving optical devices, lenses, or optical systems, surface roughness contributes to light scattering, diffuse reflection, and optical distortion, consequently diminishing transparency, imaging precision, and overall optical performance
[4]. Hence, within the CMP process, precise assessment and meticulous management of surface roughness stand as indispensable measures to uphold product excellence, ensure device reliability, and maintain process stability. Figure 10. illustrates the surface profile of the unpolished and polished glass substrate with $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$. Compared to the high roughness of the unpolished glass substrate ( $\mathrm{Sa}=3.12 \mathrm{~nm}$ ), the glass surfaces polished with $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ slurries appear smoother and free of noticeable bumps. Figure 11 highlights the surface roughness of glass substrates polished with different abrasives, showing that $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ achieves lower roughness than $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. Notably, the glass substrate polished with $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.92} \mathrm{Nd}_{0.08} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ has the lowest roughness $(\mathrm{Sa}=1.38 \mathrm{~nm})$.

Based on these findings, several observations have emerged. First of all, the glass substrates polished by polishing slurries prepared by $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.92} \mathrm{Nd}_{0.08} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive
![img-9.jpeg](images\img-9.jpeg)

![img-10.jpeg](images\img-10.jpeg)

Fig. 11 Surface roughness vs. different $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ doping contents
has the lowest surface roughness. However, according to previous experiments, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.92} \mathrm{Nd}_{0.08} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive is not the highest, nor is the abrasive size the largest. This suggests that while the chemical and mechanical effects of $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.92} \mathrm{Nd}_{0.08} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive may not be the strongest, it still achieves the lowest surface roughness. This can be attributed to a balanced synergy between chemical bonding with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and mechanical grinding, optimizing the polishing effect. When the doping amount is increased to $8 \%$, the particle size of cerium oxide is reduced to 303 nm , resulting in a diminished mechanical effect. At this doping level, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content on the surface is $34.63 \%$, and the chemical bonding is less pronounced. During the polishing process, the cerium oxide abrasive particles predominantly bond to the rough peaks and are then removed via mechanical action. Due to the smaller particle size, the wear particles are less likely to scratch the substrate during the mechanical removal process. As a result, the rough peaks are effectively removed without causing scratches on the flat areas, leading to the lowest surface roughness observed.

When the doping amount is $4 \%$, the $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Nd}_{0.04} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive exhibits the highest surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration, indicating the strongest chemical activity. However, glass substrates polished with polishing slurries prepared by $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Nd}_{0.04} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive show the highest surface roughness. This is primarily due to two factors. First, the strong chemical interaction between the abrasive and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ leads to a strong bond, causing residual $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Nd}_{0.04} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ on the substrate surface. This adhesive effect results in
the abrasive particles sticking to the substrate material, which increases surface roughness. Second, the increase in $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content facilitates the bonding and removal of both rough peaks and flat areas. The removal of flat regions leads to the formation of grooves, further increasing the surface roughness. Additionally, although the particle size of the wear particles decreases to approximately 400 nm , reducing the mechanical action, the particles exhibit an octahedral morphology, which enhances the mechanical effect due to sharper edges and angles that generate higher local pressure. This allows for more effective removal of rough peaks. However, the combination of abrasive particle adhesion and over-polishing leads to an overall increase in surface roughness. For $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive, although its morphology is a polyhedron, which is the least likely to cause surface scratches among the abrasive particles in this series, the amount of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ bonding is too small to effectively remove $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ debris from the glass substrate. In this case, mechanical action outweighs chemical action, leading to inefficient removal of the rough peaks and consequently high surface roughness after polishing.

### 3.7 CMP mechanism analysis

From a microscopic perspective, as shown in Fig. 12(a) and (b), $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ doping leads to the reduction of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive. To balance the electrical and stress effects of doping [30], some $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ is converted into $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, forming oxygen vacancies [31]. Consequently, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration and oxygen vacancy content on the

![img-11.jpeg](images\img-11.jpeg)

Fig. 12 a Atomic structure of pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and (b) Nd-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces and (c) the shape changes of abrasive particles caused by doping
$\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Nd}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives surface increase. On a larger scale, as shown in Fig. 12(c), $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ doping causes the abrasives to transition from a polyhedral to an octahedral shape and reduces their size. This alteration changes both the interaction pattern and the contact frequency during polishing.

Figure 13 illustrates a schematic of the mechanism of CMP for a glass substrate using $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive. Abrasives are dispersed within the polishing pad and come into contact with the glass substrate, performing both chemical and mechanical roles [32]. Specifically, the chemical action involves the bonding between the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}$-site of the glass substrate, post-water corrosion, and the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{OH}$ on the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surface, as represented by Eq. (7). Simultaneously, under the mechanical action exerted by polishing pads and abrasive particles, $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds with relatively weak bonding strength are more likely to break, allowing $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ debris to be taken away [33].

$$
\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{SiO}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}
$$

$\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ enhances the chemical interaction between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}[18,21,31]$, leading
to increased formation of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds forming, which facilitates the removal of more $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ fragments and thereby improves the MRR during polishing. The mechanical aspect involves the abrasive particles grinding the softened layer. As shown in Fig. 13, the abrasive particles, driven by the polishing pad, grind the rough peaks on the softened glass surface to achieve smoothness. However, due to the unique groove structure of the polishing pad, some smaller abrasives are trapped in the grooves and cannot make contact with the glass substrate surface, rendering them ineffective. Additionally, the effective area of direct contact between larger abrasive and the glass substrate surface increases, and the larger abrasives exert a greater local load on the substrate, typically resulting in lower polishing quality [34]. When the abrasive particles are polyhedral, the grinding mode is rolling, whereas with octahedral particles, the grinding mode is sliding. This sliding mode creates greater local pressure, making material removal easier but also increasing the risk of surface scratching [35].Therefore, when either the chemical or mechanical effects are too strong, the Sa increases.

![img-12.jpeg](images\img-12.jpeg)

Fig. 13 CMP mechanism diagram

Only when the two effects are balanced and optimally coordinated will the Sa reach its lowest point.

## 4 Conclusion

1. $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$-doped cerium oxide was successfully synthesized using the salt melting method. The doped cerium oxide exhibits higher surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content and smaller particle size. Additionally, the morphology transitions from polyhedral to octahedral.
2. The $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration on the surface of cerium oxide initially increases and then decreases with increasing $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ content. The increase in $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content reduces the contact angle of the polishing slurry, enhancing the effective contact between the abrasive particles and the substrate. This leads to improvements in both the chemical and mechanical effects during the polishing process.
3. With the increase in $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ doping, the particle size of cerium oxide decreases, which leads to a reduction in the mechanical effect due to the smaller particle size.
4. $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ doping causes the cerium oxide morphology to shift from polyhedral to octahedral. The octahedral shape, with its sharper edges and angles, generates higher local pressure during polishing, which increases the friction coefficient and enhances the mechanical action in the polishing process.
5. At an $8 \%$ doping level, a balance between chemical and mechanical effects is achieved, resulting in the lowest surface roughness.
