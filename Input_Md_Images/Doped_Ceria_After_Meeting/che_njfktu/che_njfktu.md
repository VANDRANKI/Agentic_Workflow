#### Abstract

The synergistic effect of photochemical oxidizing activity and frictional chemistry capability of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is essential for the development of photocatalytic-assisted chemical mechanical polishing (PCMP) abrasive system. However, the limitations of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, including its wide band gap ( $\sim 3.2 \mathrm{eV}$ ) and high rate of photogenerated carrier recombination, significantly restrict the enhancement of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ 's photochemical activity. This, in turn, obstructs the broader application of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives in post-CMP processes. As a result, this experiment employed the oxidation reaction between $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CeOHCO}_{3}$ to generate $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ intermediates. Furthermore, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ with a high concentration of oxygen vacancies (labeled as $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ ) was successfully synthesized through the thermal decomposition of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{2-}$ in a nitrogen environment. The analysis revealed that $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ exhibited higher concentrations of $\mathrm{V}_{0}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, as well as enhanced electron-hole separation efficiency and photochemical activity. Additional examination of the electronic structure of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ using first-principles calculations demonstrated that a high concentration of oxygen vacancies creates intermediate energy states near the Fermi level. This condition reduces the bandgap of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, thereby enhancing its photochemical activity. The polishing application demonstrated that the

$\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ abrasive exhibited superior polishing performance, achieving the lowest surface roughness $\left(\mathrm{Ra}=0.217 \pm 0.007 \mathrm{~nm}\right)$ and root-mean-square roughness $\left(\mathrm{RMS}=0.279 \pm 0.01\right.$ nm ) compared to commercial abrasives ( $\mathrm{Ra}=0.77 \mathrm{~nm}, \mathrm{RMS}=1.41 \mathrm{~nm}$ ), reducing Ra and RMS by $71.8 \%$ and $80.1 \%$, respectively. These results suggest that the oxygen vacancy self-doping strategy effectively enhances the concentrations of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancies in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, thereby improving its photochemical activity. This approach offers a novel concept for the further application of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives in PCMP.

# 1. Introduction 

Silicon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\right)$ has undergone extensive research and development for various applications in the semiconductor industry, primarily because of its outstanding physical and chemical properties, including high-temperature resistance, corrosion resistance, and high optical permeability. However, the increasing demand for highperformance semiconductor devices in advanced fields such as information display, aerospace, and renewable energy has resulted in stricter requirements for the flattening of glass substrates. The practical application of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ remains constrained by surface quality. Cook ${ }^{[1]}$ proposed a polishing mechanism for $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrates utilizing $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives. In this polishing mechanism, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ on the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surface acts as a strong chemical reaction site, weakening the bond between Si and O on the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film. This results in the formation of a $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ chemical bond, which enables more efficient surface planarization. The combined effect of mechanical abrasion and chemical reaction can result in the formation of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives with a high material removal rate and excellent surface finish. Furthermore, $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ has been demonstrated to exert a significant influence on the enhancement of polishing quality.

Presently, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is greatly limited for polishing applications due to its inherent deficiencies in hardness and low surface defects $\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right.$ and $\left.\mathrm{V}_{0}\right) .{ }^{[2]}$ In order to enhance the polishing efficacy of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, photocatalytic-assisted chemical-mechanical polishing (PCMP) has garnered increasing attention in recent years. In PCMP applications, the

abrasive acts as a photocatalyst to be excited under UV radiation, generating oxidized substances ( ${ }^{\prime} \mathrm{OH},{ }^{\prime} \mathrm{O}^{2-}$, etc.) during the polishing process, promoting the formation of the chemical (or photochemical) reactive layer $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$, decreasing the hardness of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$, and accelerating the removal of the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ material. ${ }^{[3]}$ Currently, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based composite abrasives have been further developed for PCMP, with the expectation that $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ will provide photocatalytic oxidation and friction chemical removal capabilities. ${ }^{[4-8]}$ However, the significant bandgap ( $\sim 3.1 \mathrm{eV}$ ) and high rate of electronhole complexation in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ negatively affect its photochemical activity, limiting its widespread application in PCMP. Consequently, enhancing the photochemical activity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ to improve the polishing effectiveness and performance of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based abrasives has emerged as a vital area of research. A number of methods have been proposed to overcome these drawbacks, such as cationic or anionic doping ${ }^{[9-14]}$, heterogeneous structure design ${ }^{[15-18]}$, and changing the calcination environment ${ }^{[19]}$. In these methods, inducing the formation of oxygen vacancies through redox reactions with $\mathrm{H}_{2}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, etc., which enhances the visible light absorption and photocatalytic properties of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, is an effective strategy to improve the photochemical activity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. Ma et al. ${ }^{[20]}$ synthesized $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles by decomposing $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ under ultrasound and demonstrated that $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$-sonication increased the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{0}$ concentrations of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, which resulted in a narrowing of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ bandgap and an enhancement in photochemical activity. The synthesis of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles with high concentrations of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{0}$ can be achieved through annealing under a reducing atmosphere using the molten salt method, as proposed by Xu et al. ${ }^{[19]}$. The resulting material exhibits a notable enhancement in photochemical activity, attributed to the intermediate energy state of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and the generation of $\mathrm{V}_{0}$ within the band gap. The preparation of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ enriched with oxygen vacancies for applications in polishing compound materials (PCMP) remains challenging. Firstly, the low concentration of oxygen vacancies in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ produced via $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$-sonication is insufficient to significantly enhance its photochemical activity. Secondly, annealing at high temperatures causes the morphology of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles to transition from spherical to octahedral shapes, resulting in significant agglomeration that may degrade polishing quality. Therefore,

the efficient synthesis of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles with a uniform spherical morphology and a high concentration of oxygen vacancies has become a key area of research.

Due to the thermal decomposition property of $\mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{2-}$, it can introduce a high concentration of oxygen vacancies in the lattice, which makes the band gap narrower and improves the photochemical activity of the material. ${ }^{[21]}$ Therefore, in this experiment we prepared $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanospheres with high concentrations of oxygen vacancies by decomposing $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{2-}$ under different calcination atmospheres (Air and $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ ) and carried out morphological, structural, and optical characterization by using XRD, SEM, TEM, HRTEM, Raman, XPS, EPR, and UV-vis, to systematically investigate the effect of oxygen vacancies on the photochemical activity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. First-principles calculations are used to propose mechanisms for the changes in band gap and photochemical activity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. Based on this, the effect of oxygen vacancies on $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ polishing properties is demonstrated in PCMP applications.

# 2. Experimental section 

### 2.1 Synthesis

A hydrothermal method was used to prepare the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive. The specific steps were as follows: $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{5} 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, and 4.5 g PVP were added to 50 ml of deionized water and mixed homogeneously with vigorous stirring at room temperature, and then a certain amount of urea (molar ratio: $\mathrm{Ce} /$ urea $=1 / 60$ ) and 60 ml of deionized water were stirred for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the two solutions were immediately mixed and kept stirring for 1 h , then the mixed solution was loaded into a hydrothermal kettle and heated to $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 4 h . Then, the samples were subjected to centrifugation and repeated washing with ethanol and deionized water, followed by drying at $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 10 hours to obtain $\mathrm{CeOHCO}_{3}$. Finally, the $\mathrm{CeOHCO}_{3}$ sample was divided into two parts, and one part was annealed in air at $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 4 h to obtain $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles, which served as a control group. The remaining portion was dispersed in an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide $(0.75 \mathrm{M})$ and heated to $75^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for two hours. Centrifugation was then employed to obtain the precipitate, which was subsequently dried at $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 12 hours and divided into three portions. One portion was dried and

preserved, designated as $\mathrm{HCeOHCO}_{3}$, while the remaining two portions were subjected to annealing at $500{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for four hours in air and nitrogen, respectively, to yield the products $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$. The schematic diagram of the synthesis is shown in Scheme 1.

# 2.2 Characterization 

The crystal structure of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ was analyzed utilizing an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, X' Pert PRO) with $\mathrm{Cu} \mathrm{K} \alpha$ radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA . XRD data were obtained by continuous scanning in the range of $20^{\circ}$ to $80^{\circ}(2 \theta)$ at a scanning speed of $10^{\circ} / \mathrm{min}$. Data were processed by Jade 6.5 software. The particle morphology and element distribution of sintered powder specimens were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Gemini SEM 300) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2010F, JEOL). The valence states of Cerium $\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+} / \mathrm{Ce}^{4+}\right)$ were characterized using the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB-250Xi) characterization was performed using $\mathrm{Al} \mathrm{K} \alpha$ targets excited at 1486.6 eV energy at a test pressure of $10^{-8} \mathrm{~Pa}$, energy resolution $\leq 0.45 \mathrm{eV}$ and spatial resolution $\leq 20 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. Raman spectra were recorded on a Thermo Nicolet 6700-NXR apparatus with an excitation source of 532 nm . Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were tracked using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (QM-8000). Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance

spectra (UV-vis DRS) were collected on a Lambda750S UV-vis spectrophotometer.

# 2.3 DFT calculations 

The density functional calculations were carried out with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). ${ }^{[22,23]}$ The electron wave functions were described using the projector augmented wave (PAW) method. Plane waves were included up to an energetic cut-off of $500 \mathrm{eV} .{ }^{[24]}$ The exchange-correlation effects were treated with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE). ${ }^{[22,25]}$ The effective Hubbard parameter U was employed to account for the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion amongst the localized 4 f orbital for the lanthanide series elements. In this study, $\mathrm{U}=5 \mathrm{eV}$ was applied to the 4 f states of Ce , and in addition, $\mathrm{U}=5.5 \mathrm{eV}$ was applied to the 2 p states of $\mathrm{O} .{ }^{[24,26]} \mathrm{~A} 2 \times 2 \times 2$ supercell of the cubic fluorite structure with 96 atoms was used as the initial structural model. ${ }^{[24]} \mathrm{A}$ cubic unit cell of C-type $\mathrm{Ce}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ can be constructed out of eight $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ unit cells by increasing their volume by $3 \%$ and removing $25 \%$ of the oxygen atoms along four nonintersecting $<$ h111> diagonals. ${ }^{[27]}$

### 2.4 CMP experiment

In this experiment, round quartz glass of $20 \mathrm{~mm} * 2 \mathrm{~mm}$ size was used as the polishing substrate, and three pieces of quartz glass were glued to an aluminium alloy plate with paraffin wax around three symmetrical points on the mounting plate. CMP and PCMP tests were carried out using a precision polishing machine (UNIPOL-1200S, Shenyang Kejing Co., Ltd., China). The abrasive was selected as $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ powder to formulate a slurry with $2.5 \% \mathrm{wt}$ of solids. The pH of the formulated polishing solution was adjusted to 10 using $0.1 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L} \mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ solution and used after ultrasonic treatment for 20 min at room temperature. In the PCMP experiments, the pressure was set to 3 N , the polishing time was 4 min , and the head speed and platen speed were both 60 rpm . The slurry was irradiated using a 250 W halogen lamp as a UV source (wavelength of 365 nm ) for 30 min before the PCMP. After the PCMP experiment, the wafers were repeatedly cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in ethanol and deionized water.

The polished surfaces were analyzed by AFM (Ntegra Prima SPM, NT-MDT,

Russia) atomic force microscopy in Taping mode, with a scanning range of $5.0 \times 5.0$ $\mu \mathrm{m}^{2}$ for all AFM experiments. The data were then processed using NanoScope Analysis software to obtain the surface morphology map, the cross-section trajectory map, and surface roughness. Finally, the material removal rate (MRR) was calculated by measuring the difference in sample mass before and after polishing with a precision balance, as shown in Eq. (1) ${ }^{[4]}$.

$$
\mathrm{MRR}=\frac{\Delta \mathrm{m} \times 10^{7}}{\rho \mathrm{~S} \tau}
$$

Where $\Delta \mathrm{m}(\mathrm{g})$ is the mass difference of the quartz glass sample before and after CMP; $\rho$ is the density of the quartz glass sample, which is about $2.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3} ; \mathrm{S}$ is the total contact area of quartz glass and polishing pad $\left(\mathrm{cm}^{2}\right) ; \tau$ is the polishing time (min).

# 3. Results and discussion 

### 3.1 Structural and physicochemical properties

## XRD

The crystal structures of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ samples were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results presented in Fig. 1 indicate that both $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ maintain the cubic fluorite structure of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (PDF-34-0394), exhibiting no evidence of other impurity phases. The average grain sizes of the three samples were calculated by Scherrer's formula $\mathrm{D}=\mathrm{k} \lambda / \beta \cos \theta^{[28]}$, based on the (111) crystal plane, where $\lambda$ is the X-ray wavelength, $\theta$ is the X-ray diffraction angle, and $\beta$ is the halfheight width of the (111) peak. The calculated results show that the average grain sizes of $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ are $10.81 \mathrm{~nm}, 12.49 \mathrm{~nm}$ and 12.51 nm , respectively. The small grain sizes of $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ are attributed to the presence of a high concentration of defects at the surface or at grain boundaries, which can impede the growth of nanograins. Furthermore, the lattice constants of the (111) sample were calculated using Jade software, resulting in values of $5.412 \AA, 5.409 \AA$, and $5.407 \AA$ for $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, respectively. Lattice expansion is typically associated with surface defects $\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right.$ and $\left.\mathrm{V}_{0}\right) .{ }^{[10]} \mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ samples that have undergone annealing and exhibit surface defects show significant lattice strain. To reduce lattice

strain, the lattice size of $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ samples decreases, leading to an increase in the lattice constant. In the case of $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$, the surface defects created during annealing are compensated by atmospheric oxygen, resulting in a smaller increase in the lattice constant.

# SEM and TEM 

Studies have shown that interfaces and grain boundaries serve as active sites for the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{0}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems. The likelihood of defect formation near grain boundaries is influenced by the local atomic structure and the orientation of nearby particles. ${ }^{[10]}$ As illustrated in Fig. 2 (a), (b), and (c), the spherical morphology and uniform size of $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ remain consistent. As can be observed in the enlarged images of the red areas in Fig. 2 (e), (f), and (g), the lattice stripes of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ are visible. It can be seen that there are significant overlapping folds between the lattice stripes of $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ (indicated by the red arrows), which is a consequence of the presence of oxygen vacancy defects at the grain boundaries, resulting in the misalignment of the lattice stripes. ${ }^{[29]}$ Subsequent measurements of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ showed a crystal plane spacing of $0.306 \mathrm{~nm}, 0.308 \mathrm{~nm}$, and 0.313 nm , respectively, corresponding to the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (111) crystal plane. According to Eq. (2), the observed increase in crystal plane spacing is directly related to the increase in lattice constant, as determined by

XRD analysis. Fig. 2 (d), and (h) show comparative high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$. The red dashed circles in the figures indicate that, unlike $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ displays fuzzy lattice stripes in the edge region, which are attributed to the formation of oxygen vacancy defects. ${ }^{[30]}$

# Raman 

The Raman spectra of each sample are shown in Fig. 3. The spectrum shown in Fig. 3(a) reveals that the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$-treated precursor $\mathrm{CeOHCO}_{3}$ displays a distinct vibrational peak at approximately $830 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, highlighted by the red dashed box. This peak corresponds to the characteristic $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{2-}$. The observed peak is attributed to the intermediate $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ generated by the redox reaction between $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, as detailed in Eq. (3) ${ }^{[31]}$ As illustrated in Fig. 3 (b), the $\mathrm{F}_{2 \mathrm{~g}}$ characteristic peak of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$

appears at $465 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ for the sample annealed according to Eq. (4). $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ exhibits a pronounced vibrational peak near $600 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3 (b). Conversely, the peak intensity of $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ that was annealed in air is diminished. In general, an increase in the intensity ratio of $I_{600} / I_{463}$ is indicative of an increase in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{o}}$ content. The oxygen vacancy rates were calculated to be $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(0.02), \mathrm{NCeO}_{2}(0.044)$, and $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}(0.028)$ for each sample. Furthermore, the Raman vibrational mode near $1174 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ in the right inset of Fig. 3 (b) is correlated with the O-O stretching vibrational mode of the superoxide radical ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{O}^{2-},{ }^{[32]}$ and it can be observed that the intensity of this peak is higher in both $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ than that of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The formation of ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{-}$is due to the interaction of the adsorbed oxygen on the surface with the electrons trapped in the oxygen vacancies, indicating that the oxygen defects are higher in both $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$.

# XPS 

In order to gain a deeper understanding of the oxygen vacancy concentration variations of the samples, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to characterize the valence information of the corresponding cerium elements of the three abrasives. The data were analyzed using a nonlinear peak fitting method for the Ce 3d spectra, as illustrated in Fig. 4 (a). The Ce 3d energy level comprises two pairs of spin orbitals, $3 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}$ and $3 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}$. The peaks in the Ce 3 d core energy peaks, modulated by the

fluctuations in the Ce 4 f electronic states, reflect the variations between $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}{ }^{[33]}$ The Ce3d core level spectra were further analyzed using nonlinear peak fitting methods. The peaks corresponding to the spin-orbit $3 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}$ and $3 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}$ are labeled as u and v , respectively. The peaks labelled as $\mathrm{u}^{\prime \prime \prime}, \mathrm{u}^{\prime \prime}, \mathrm{u}, \mathrm{v}^{\prime \prime \prime}, \mathrm{v}^{\prime \prime}$, v represent $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, while peaks labelled as $\mathrm{u}^{\prime}, \mathrm{u}_{0}, \mathrm{v}^{\prime}, \mathrm{v}_{0}$ correspond to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. The presence of both $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ peaks across all samples indicates a mixed valence state of +3 and +4 within the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ samples. The valence state of Ce was semi-quantitatively analyzed using the peak area ratio, as described Eq. (5), ${ }^{[33]}$ and the results are shown in Fig. 4 (b). The $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive was $22.32 \%$, and for $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ abrasives, it rose to $27.31 \%$ and $33.59 \%$, respectively, which indicates that thermal decomposition of $\mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{2-}$ enhances $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration, supporting the preliminary findings from Raman analysis. Fig. 4 (c) illustrates the nonlinear fitting of the O 1 s fine spectra of the abrasives. In this context, O 1 is typically defined as surface-adsorbed oxygen, O 2 as adsorbed oxygen at oxygen vacancies, and O 3 as lattice oxygen. A comparison of the O 1 peak areas among the three samples indicated that the O 1 surface-adsorbed oxygen peak area for $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ represented the highest proportion. This result supports the hypothesis that oxygen from the surrounding environment can offset oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, the lattice peaks of $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ exhibit a shift towards higher binding energies, indicative of a reduction in the electron density of lattice oxygen. This phenomenon is associated with an increase in the concentration of oxygen defects in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. ${ }^{[18]}$ The $\mathrm{V}_{0}$ content was calculated according to Eq. (6) ${ }^{[34]}$, and the $\mathrm{V}_{0}$ contents of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ were $26.51 \%, 45.82 \%$ and $48.51 \%$, respectively. According to Eq. (7-9), ${ }^{[35]} \mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{2-}$ decomposition during calcination produces $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, which generates oxygen defects in the lattice because $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ can be released rapidly. The decomposition environment is rich in $\mathrm{O}^{2-}$ ions, which hinders the reduction reaction of Eq. (9). As the reaction proceeds, the oxidation reaction of Eq. (8) is more likely to occur, increasing the $\mathrm{V}_{0}$ concentration. The storage and release of oxygen in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ are optimized when the temperature is exceeding $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. At lower temperature, the rate of surface oxygen diffusion decreases, facilitating its retention within the lattice structure. ${ }^{[20]}$ Consequently, once the decomposition reaction is complete, oxygen from the air fills the vacancies in the lattice

during the cooling process. This results in a decreased rate of increase in the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{o}}$ concentration of $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$. Furthermore, comparing $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ revealed that the rate of increase in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{o}}$ concentration diminished under altered atmospheric conditions. This indicates that the primary factor contributing to the observed increase in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{o}}$ concentration is $\mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{2-}$ decomposition.

# UV 

To evaluate the effect of oxygen vacancies on the band gap of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, we examined the optical properties of the three samples using UV-vis spectroscopy. Fig. 5 (a) illustrates that the wavelengths of $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ display a significant red shift, with the absorption tail of $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ extending into the visible region, which is not observed in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The extended absorption tail in $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ can be attributed to the presence of high concentrations of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{o}} .{ }^{[36]}$ The optical bandgap of the samples can be evaluated further on the basis of the Kubel-Munk function, and the corresponding plots of $(\alpha h v)^{2}$ versus $(h v)$ are shown in Fig. 5 (b), yield bandgaps of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(3.08 \mathrm{eV}), \mathrm{NCeO}_{2}(2.86 \mathrm{eV})$, and $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}(2.98 \mathrm{eV})$. The individual samples

displayed a redshift in the UV absorption curves and a narrowing of the bandgap, attributed to the increased concentrations of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{0}$. These results align with the findings from XPS and Raman analysis.

# PL 

The photoluminescence (PL) spectral characterization of materials is commonly used to evaluate the efficiency of the complexation of photogenerated electrons ( $\mathrm{e}^{-}$) and holes $\left(\mathrm{h}^{+}\right)$. Research indicates that a reduction in the rate of $\mathrm{e}^{-}$and $\mathrm{h}^{+}$complexation increases the lifetime of photogenerated charge carriers, thereby enhancing the material's photochemical activity. ${ }^{[37]}$ Furthermore, this is supported by the observed decrease in peak intensities in the PL spectra. Fig. 6 (a) illustrates the PL spectra of all the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ samples. From Fig. 6 (a), it can be observed that there is a clear peak between wavelengths of $480-510 \mathrm{~nm}$, corresponding to the defect energy level between the Ce 4 f and O 2 p bands. ${ }^{[38]}$ A significant decrease in the PL intensity of $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ compared to $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ was observed. In contrast, the PL intensity of $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ was higher than that of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The PL intensity could be affected by the presence of both radiative and nonradiative defects, located within the bulk and on the surface of the material. The presence of defects within the body results in an increase in PL intensity, whereas defects on the surface of the material lead to a reduction in PL intensity. ${ }^{[10]}$ In conclusion, $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ possesses a high density of oxygen defects on its surface. These

defect centers function as non-radiative complexes, enhancing the segregation and transport of photogenerated electron-hole pairs, thereby suppressing the PL intensity of $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ while simultaneously improving its photochemical activity. In contrast, for $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$, the PL intensity is primarily influenced by the defects within the lattice, which compensate for the adsorbed oxygen on the surface, resulting in an increase in PL intensity. Fig. 6 (b) depicts the EPR signals of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ nanostructures. Fig. $6(\mathrm{~b}, \mathrm{c})$ demonstrates that all three structures exhibit signal peaks at 3515 G and $\mathrm{g}=2.00$, which are attributed to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in the samples. ${ }^{[39]}$ In this case, it can be observed that the intensity of the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ signal is higher for both $\mathrm{ACeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ than for $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$; this increase in intensity is due to the formation of defects in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ as a result of $\mathrm{Ce}-$ $\mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{2-}$ decomposition and the reduction of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. The analytical results indicate that $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{0}$ effectively enhance the transfer of photogenerated electrons, inhibit the complexation of photogenerated carriers, and improve the photochemical activity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$.

# DFT 

This study further explores the effect of oxygen vacancies on the electronic properties of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ through the use of first-principles calculations. This study examines the density of states (DOS) near the Fermi energy level, which primarily reflects the electronic structure of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. Fig. 7 illustrates the DOS of systems containing $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ with different oxygen vacancy concentrations. As shown in Fig. 7 (a), the band gap of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is approximately 2.38 eV . When an oxygen vacancy is introduced into the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice, the density of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is shifted to the low-energy state as can be seen in Fig. 7 (b), which

is due to the introduction of the oxygen vacancy, ${ }^{[24,33]}$ and the band gap width is slightly narrowed to 2.31 eV . In contrast to the preceding two cases, $25 \%$ oxygen vacancies are incorporated into the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice in a particular manner (as illustrated in Fig. 7 (e)), resulting in the emergence of new bandgap states in proximity to the Fermi energy level. This phenomenon leads to a narrowing of the band gap, as depicted in Fig. 7 (c). The PDOS diagram shown in Fig. 7 (d) that the gap state is mainly from the Ce 4f state, which indicates that the Ce 4 f orbital is partially occupied by two electrons generated after the formation of the oxygen vacancy. And the electron of Ce 4 f state is localized on the Ce ion around the oxygen vacancy, which will promote the two neighboring $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ reduction to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. Fig. 7 (f) shows the impact of $\mathrm{V}_{0}$ concentration on the energy band structure of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, as derived from the DOS variation. In the case of a low oxygen vacancy concentration, the defect level has a negligible effect on the band gap width (as illustrated in Fig. 7 (b)). ${ }^{[24]}$ When the concentration of oxygen vacancies in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ increases further, a new energy gap state emerges near the Fermi energy level (as shown in Fig. 7 (c)). This phenomenon results in a narrowing of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ band gap and an enhancement of its photochemical activity. This analysis effectively explains the redshift observed in the absorption edge of the UV spectrum presented in Fig. 5 (a).

Fig. 8 illustrates the schematic structure of the self-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ system. The free electrons generated within the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ system are readily stored due to the presence of Ce 4 f orbitals, which are responsible for the conversion of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. ${ }^{[40]}$ As shown in Fig. 8 (a), $\mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{2-}$ decomposes during calcination and oxidizes to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, which forms oxygen vacancies in the lattice due to the rapid release of $\mathrm{O}_{2} \cdot{ }^{[35]}$ The spillage of molecular oxygen releases two free electrons in the vacancies to maintain electrical neutrality as shown in Fig. 8 (b). It is noteworthy that $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ around the oxygen vacancies can trap electrons according to Eq. (10) ${ }^{[33]}$, leading to the transformation of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ as shown in Fig. 8 (c).

# 3.2 Polishing performances 

### 3.2.1 Surface analysis and removal efficiency

Surface quality and removal efficiency are the key indicators for evaluating the performance of abrasives. In this experiment, high-resolution atomic force microscopy was utilized to observe the evolution of the surface morphology of substrate after polishing, including two-dimensional (2D) height images, three-dimensional (3D)

images, as shown in Fig. 9 (a-f). For the cross-section profile analysis, the diagonal line in the 2D-AFM height image was selected for scanning measurement and further comparison, X denotes the length of the line profile, the Z -axis denotes the depth of the line profile, and the improvement of the surface quality can be evidenced by the reduction of the roughness of the line profile, ${ }^{[36]}$ as shown in Fig. 9 (g-i).

Combined with the above characterization of the crystal structure and photochemical activity of the three abrasives, the $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ abrasive was selected for the CMP and PCMP processes, respectively. As illustrated Fig. 9 (a, d), it can be seen that the surface before polishing is highly undulating with a large number of rough peaks. The maximum valley depth (MVD) of the pre-polished surface is about 4.812 nm and the maximum peak height (MPH) is about 5.212 nm as observed from Fig. 9 (g). From Fig. 9 (h), the maximum valley depth (MVD) of the substrate after CMP treatment is 0.981 nm , the maximum peak height (MPH) is 1.482 nm , and a large number of nanosized roughness peaks still exist on the surface of the substrate after CMP, as can be seen by the AFM images in Fig. 9 (b, e). This is attributable to the insufficient hardness of $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ and its inadequate mechanical action in the conventional CMP process. Fig. 9 (i) depicts that the maximum valley depth (MVD) of the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surface after PCMP treatment is 0.521 nm , while the maximum peak height (MPH) is 0.744 nm . A comparison of Fig. 9 (b, c) and (e, f) demonstrates that the majority of the roughness peaks associated with defects on the substrate surface were effectively removed following PCMP polishing. These observations indicate a notable enhancement in surface quality.

As illustrated in Fig. 10, the bar chart demonstrates that Ra and RMS of substrates before polishing were 0.957 nm and 1.263 nm , respectively, within $5.0 \times 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ area. Following CMP and PCMP, the Ra of substrate was reduced to 0.471 nm and 0.217 nm , respectively, while the RMS was 0.773 nm and 0.279 nm . After PCMP, Ra and RMS were reduced by $53.9 \%, 71.8 \%$, and $67.7 \%, 80.1 \%$, respectively, in comparison to the $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}(\mathrm{CMP})$, and the previously reported commercial $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ sample. ${ }^{[41]}$

Fig 10. The surface roughness after CMP and PCMP.
As illustrated in Fig. 9 and 10, the as-prepared abrasives were capable of markedly enhancing the surface quality, resulting in an atomically smooth and scratch-free surface by comparison with the original substrate. In order to reduce the variability of the polishing results, three random measurement locations were selected on the polishing plane of each sample and the surface roughness (Ra), and the root mean square roughness (RMS) roughness results were averaged and listed in Table 1.

The removal of material is another key indicator for the evaluation of the polishing performance of abrasive particles. In this work, the MRR-PCMP of the prepared $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ abrasive was approximately $361.89 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$, representing a $24.92 \%$ improvement over the CMP (without UV irradiation, approximately $289.52 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ). Based on the results of the above analysis, it is shown that the proposed abrasive for PCMP achieves almost scratch-free and highly flattened surfaces with very low roughness.

# 3.2.2 Proposed PCMP Mechanism 

In the process of polishing, the $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$in the alkaline slurry initially reacts with the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds on the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surface. Subsequently, the resulting $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ hydration layer can be removed by induced shear (or friction) from the granular abrasive and pad roughness. As in the chemical tooth model proposed by Cook, ${ }^{[1]}$ the chemically reactive layer can be removed by solid-state frictional chemical reactions occurring at the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ interface.

Fig. 11 presents a schematic diagram of the photo-oxidation mechanism of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. In contrast to the conventional CMP, in the PCMP system, when $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is irradiated by UV light, photogenerated electrons $\left(\mathrm{e}^{-}\right)$are excited from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band $(\mathrm{CB})$, and a photogenerated hole $\left(\mathrm{h}^{+}\right)$is left at the VB position. For the wide bandgap semiconductor $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, photogenerated electrons tend to complex with holes due to the Coulomb force associated with the larger bandgap. This interaction hinders the effectiveness of the photocatalytic oxidation process, as shown in Fig. 11

(a). In the newly proposed $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ system shown in Fig. 11 (b), a high concentration of oxygen vacancies leads to the emergence of a new gap state near the Fermi energy level of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, which narrows the overall band gap. Combined with the UV spectra and Eqs. (11), and (12), ${ }^{[3]}$ where $\chi$ is the absolute electronegativity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(5.57 \mathrm{eV})$, and $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{e}}$ is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (NHE, 4.5 eV ). ${ }^{[3]}$ Calculations give $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{VB}}$ and $\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{CB}}$ of 2.5 eV and -0.36 eV for $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$, respectively. In this system, when $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is irradiated by UV light, the photogenerated electron ( $\mathrm{e}^{-}$) can migrate from the VB of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ to the CB , and the photogenerated hole ( $\mathrm{h}^{+}$) can be retained in the VB. The resulting $\mathrm{h}^{+}$can then react with $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$or $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to produce a strong oxidizing ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{OH}$ radical. The $\mathrm{e}^{-}$migrating to the CB to be excited can trap the dissolved oxygen in the slurry to produce ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{O}^{2-}$ radicals. ${ }^{[42]}$ Consequently, the $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ system effectively reduces the complexation rate of photo-generated electron-hole ( $\mathrm{e}^{-} / \mathrm{h}^{+}$) pairs, consistent with the findings from PL spectral analysis (Fig. 6). According to the literature ${ }^{[43]}$, the generated reactive species $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{OH},{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{O}^{2-}\right.$, etc.), during the PCMP process, promote the formation of the chemically reactive layer $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$, which in turn facilitates the material removal.

& \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{VB}}=\chi-\mathrm{Ee}+1 / 2 \mathrm{Eg} \\
& \mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{CB}}=\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{VB}}-\mathrm{Eg}

$$

Fig. 11 (c-e) illustrates a schematic representation of the polishing process for

PCMP, which is divided into three distinct phases: a chemical softening phase, a mechanical removal phase, and a polishing completion phase. ${ }^{[38,44]}$ In the initial phase, robust oxidation species $\left({ }^{\cdot} \mathrm{OH},{ }^{\cdot} \mathrm{O}^{2-}\right)$ generated by UV irradiation oxidize $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ into $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ within a humid environment. This reaction produces a malleable layer of $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ that can be easily removed, as highlighted by the yellow region marked with a red arrow in the figure. In the second stage, applying mechanical stress leads to the formation of a - $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ - structure between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$. This facilitates the effective removal of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ during the polishing process. Finally, in the third stage, an exceptionally smooth $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surface is achieved through the reaction and friction between $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and the polishing pad.

# 4. Conclusions 

In this study, we successfully prepared $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ with a high concentration of oxygen vacancies by introducing these vacancies into the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice via self-doping. This was achieved through a straightforward oxidation reaction between $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. This method differs from traditional doping techniques, as it does not introduce any impurity elements. Our findings indicate that a substantial concentration of oxygen vacancies acts as a trap center and facilitates the generation of novel defect energy levels in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, close to the Fermi energy level. Consequently, this leads to a reduction in the band gap and an increase in photochemical oxidation activity. High-resolution AFM results reveal that ultra-smooth and high-quality surfaces can be obtained, exhibiting Ra values of 0.217 nm and RMS values of 0.274 nm within $5.0 \times 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ area under PCMP conditions. Ra and RMS were reduced by $53.9 \%$ and $67.7 \%$, respectively, in comparison to the $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}(\mathrm{CMP})$. As anticipated, The $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ abrasive further provided $24.94 \%$ increment of RR-PCMP by comparison with RR-CMP ( $361.89 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ vs $289.52 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ). The increase in MRR-PCMP is attributed to two factors: the generation of highly reactive oxygen species ( $\mathrm{OH},{ }^{\cdot} \mathrm{O}^{2-}$, etc.), which promotes the formation of chemically reactive soft layers in the slurry. Additionally, the increased concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ on the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surface accelerates the formation and breakage of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds, thereby improving polishing efficiency. In conclusion, the $\mathrm{NCeO}_{2}$ used

in this study, characterized by a high concentration of oxygen vacancies, exhibited favorable PCMP properties. The findings will serve as a theoretical and experimental foundation for $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based abrasive polishing.
