Photocatalytic-assisted chemical-mechanical polishing (PCMP) is an ultra-precision machining method which combines photocatalytic technology with chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) technology. $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ has unique physicochemical properties (tribological properties and photochemical oxidation activity) and is applied to industrial fields extensively. In this paper, a series of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles with controlled size and shape were produced by the molten salt method. SEM images show that $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles are nearly spherical with a size of about $113-148 \mathrm{~nm}$. Ion doping can adjust the defect concentration and further enhance the chemical activity of samples. XPS spectra show that doping is beneficial to improve the concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy. In this way, the photocatalytic activity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles can be improved. Quartz glasses were polished by synthetic $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticle polishing solution, where x is the doping amount. The results show that the material removal rate (MRR) of $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives in PCMP was increased by $34.5 \%$. The PCMP mechanism of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles is further discussed. Ultraviolet irradiation increased the reactive sites on the surface of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles, making them have better chemical activity. The hydration layer and Ce-O-Si bond on the surface of quartz glass are formed more easily, thus improving the material removal rate.

## 1. Introduction

Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is one of the vital technologies in semiconductor chip manufacturing [1]. Compared with the traditional polishing process, CMP effectively avoids the surface damage, the low polishing rate, the low surface smoothness, and the poor consistency [2]. The CMP system is mainly composed of polishing equipment, polishing fluid, and polishing pad. Among them, the polishing slurry is the crucial factor influencing the performance and efficiency of chemical mechanical polishing. Material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness (Ra) are ordinarily used to evaluate the properties of polishing fluid. As the most important component of polishing fluid, the size and morphology of abrasive nanoparticles directly affect the surface quality and polishing efficiency of processed materials. $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is widely used in mobile phone screen, optical glass, liquid crystal display, hard disk and other products of chemical mechanical polishing, because of its uniform
friction chemical activity, chemical tooth effect and moderate hardness. Ce element has a variety of valence states and easy to be converted between different valence states, easy oxidation or complexing glass surface material. Thus, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ has become one of the most effective polishing abrasives [2]. In addition, cerium oxide has redox properties and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+} / \mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ conversion, therefore, it is also a rare earth semiconductor photocatalyst.

Along with the rapid development of high-tech, the requirement of silicon oxide wafer is more and more demanding. Based on the chemical mechanical polishing and photocatalytic properties of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, the predecessors combined the two and proposed the photocatalytic-assisted chemical-mechanical polishing (PCMP) technology, which further improve the material removal rate of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives. $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives have mechanical wear (or tribological properties) and photochemical oxidation activity, necessary for the PCMP systems. However, there are three major problems for photocatalysis of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. That is, it has a wide

band gap ( $\sim 3.2 \mathrm{eV}$ ), the poor light absorption performance and the high photogenerated carrier recombination rate. These limit the enhancement of photocatalytic activity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ photocatalyst. It is of major significance to improve the photocatalytic activity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles in PCMP. It is suggested that the photocatalytic performance of $\mathrm{GeO}_{2}$ can be precisely regulated by adjusting the photoelectron-hole recombination rate [3]. Some improvement methods, such as morphology regulation, doping modification [4], precious metal deposition, and heterojunction construction could be applied to solve the two problems.

In order to enhance the polishing rate of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{Xu}$ et al. [5] prepared nano-sheet $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ with octahedral and cubic morphology by hydrothermal method. The test results indicated that the crystal size was uniform, and the polishing efficiency and quality were bound up with the morphology. Zhang et al. [6] modified the surface hydroxyl and G-aminopropyl trimethoxy-silane (silane) by silanizing in order to strengthen the CMP performance of ceria. The results demonstrated that APS was favorably grafted onto the surface of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, making the modified cerium oxide have better dispersion and stability in aqueous solution. The MRR of modified $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles was $267 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$, lower than that of pure nanoparticles $389 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$, but the surface quality ( $R M S=0.815 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) was significantly better than that of unmodified $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles (RMS $=1.440 \mathrm{~nm}$ ). This result may be related to the reduced hardness of the modified $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles. Kim et al. [7] synthesized lanthanide elements (La and Nd) doped with different concentrations by hydrothermal method to increase the concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}, \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ doped with lanthanum trivalent ions forms oxygen vacancies, which reduced the circumambient $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. When the doping amount of Nd improved to 0.0075 , the concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ increased to $32.57 \%$. The reduction of work function of cerium doped nanoparticles and the enhancement of binding force with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ were measured, which verified that the polishing performance of high concentration neodymium-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is 3.62 times higher than that of the control group. Cheng et al. [8] synthesized lanthanide metal (Yb, La and Nd) doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoscale abrasives by an improved initial impregnation method for polishing of silicon wafers, and the MRR increased by $29.6 \%$, corresponding roughness is 0.96 nm . Chen et al. [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] prepared a series of core-shell structure abrasives. The polishing test was carried out on the silicon wafer. The experimental results show that the core-shell structure abrasive has better performance in polishing surface quality, the Ra can reach 0.15 nm . Wang et al. [21] prepared the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles by urea condensation method have good monodisperse properties, and the surface quality of the prepared polishing slurry was better than that of the commercial slurry, and the removal rate of silicon oxide was increased by $153 \%$ (pH $\sim 4$ ) and $100 \%$ (pH $\sim 10$ ). Xu et al. [22] prepared excellent chemical active $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles in reducing atmosphere (Ar and $\mathrm{Ar} / \mathrm{H}_{2}$ ) by using molten salt method. The result of the experiment was that the MRR and $R a$ of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Ar} / \mathrm{H}_{2}$ abrasive on $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate were $691.28 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ and 0.5 nm , respectively.

Over the last few years, PCMP has been applied to many materials requiring surface flattening. Hsieh et al. [23] reviewed the latest progress of friction-CMP, electric-CMP (ECMP), photocatalytic CMP (PCMP), sulfate-PCMP and other CMP and hybrid CMP technologies for SiC wafer surface processing. The oxidation behavior and polishing properties of these materials are emphasized. It is also considered that MRR remains unchanged in the UV-irradiated group and is negatively correlated with surface roughness. Murata et al. [24] proposed an efficient and environment-friendly 4 H-SiC (0001) electrochemical mechanical polishing (ECMP) method with an MRR of about $15 \mu \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{h}$, nearly 10 times that of the CMP method. This method removes surface damage and produces a smooth surface with high MRR across the entire wafer scale. Wang et al. [25] systematically reviewed the progress of chemical, mechanical, and chemical-mechanical collaborative methods in improving the properties of chemical-mechanical composites, pointing out that PCMP only requires an additional UV light source and does not require structural modifications to existing CMP devices. In addition, PCMP can improve MRR while maintaining excellent surface quality.

Therefore, PCMP technology has a great prospect. Lee et al. [26] conducted a comparative study of CMP, mixing abrasive paste CMP (MAS CMP) and PCMP from a tribological perspective. The experimental results show that SiC CMP has higher friction and processing temperature than MAS CMP and ordinary CMP, which may be caused by photocatalytic oxidation and $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ particles as photocatalyst. Lu et al. [27] sedimented $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ photocatalyst on diamond particles, the net result is that prepared diamond abrasives obtained MRR $(0.114 \mu \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{h})$ exceed that of traditional diamond abrasives $(0.061 \mu \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{h})$ under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Yuan et al. [28] used $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ abrasive to perform precision PCMP on 4 H-SiC wafers. The MRR and Ra of the polishing slurry could reach $0.95 \mu \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{h}$ and 0.35 nm . Kim et al. [29] used UV light to directly irradiate cerium oxide polishing slurry, indicating that the MRR of the oxide film was about $40 \%$ higher than that of the conventional cerium oxide polishing slurry when ultraviolet radiation is irradiated for 50 h . In addition, the effects of polyacid photooxidative degradation on the photoreduction and chemical-mechanical polishing properties of cerium oxide nanoparticles at different concentrations and UV irradiation times were also studied [30]. The concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ increases with the i ultraviolet irradiation time and polyacid concentration, which improves the CMP performance, the MRR increases by $87 \%$, and the wafer surface roughness decreases by $48 \%$. Gao et al. [31] developed a newfangled polystyrene (PS)/ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ multi-component core/shell abrasive and conducted PCMP experiments on RB-SiC. The results showed that $R a$ and MRR of PS/ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ abrasive could reach 0.497 nm and $1.223 \mu \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{h}$ under ultraviolet irradiation. Chen et al. [32], [33] synthesized PS/ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{PS} / \mathrm{PANI} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ particles with core-shell structure as functional abrasive nanoparticles for PCMP applications. The MRR of PS/ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ composite abrasives in PCMP was enhanced by $85 \%$ compared with conventional CMP. The MRR-PCMP ( $139 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ) of $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ abrasive was increased by approximately $196 \%$ compared to the MRR ( $47 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ) of undoped abrasive. The improved performance of PCMP may be attributed to the synergistic effect of the $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ heterostructure (overall modulus reduction, construction of $\mathrm{CS}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ heterojunction, treatment of surface defects, etc.). Fan et al. [34] synthesized polystyrene/ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ core-shell abrasive doped with lanthanides (La, Nd and Eu) by an improved in-situ chemical precipitation method. In PCMP of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film, the MRR of the prepared polishing slurry was $174.3 \pm 7.6 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$, which was $163 \%$ higher than that of CMP. The surface roughness (Ra) in the local area decreased from the initial $0.82 \pm 0.01 \mathrm{~nm}$ to $0.36 \pm 0.05 \mathrm{~nm}$. The mechanism of PCMP remains unknown. Hence, it is significant to decipher the internal mechanism of PCMP to promote the development of surface machining technology. In addition, the molten salt method possesses the merits of preparation process with fewer steps, uniform chemical composition of synthetic nanoparticles and so on. The morphology and size of the product can be regulated by adjusting the type, dosage, synthesis temperature, holding time and other parameters of molten salt. Molten salt method is considered as a kind of nanomaterials preparation technology with high application potential.
$\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ has good physicochemical properties, especially its nanostructure, which is widely used in energy, environmental protection and other fields. Tang et al. [35] reviewed the synthesis, characterization and traditional and new applications of nanostructured $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ based materials in recent years. It is pointed out that the photogenerated carriers on the (100) and (111) crystal planes have high mobility, which is more conducive to charge separation, and thus more conducive to the improvement of cerium dioxide based photocatalyst activity. Liyanage et al. [36] prepared yttrium-doped cerium nanorods by hydrothermal synthesis method, and the results showed that the number of oxygen vacancies of cerium oxide nanorods increased with the increase of Y concentration. At room temperature, the photocatalytic activity of the composite nanorods with less than $50 \% \mathrm{Y}$ doping is higher than that of pure cerium dioxide. Xu et al. [37] prepared Y-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ with hollow spheroidal structure by hydrothermal method with high photocatalytic activity, which is attributed to more oxygen vacancies and surface

reactive oxygen species. The maximum rate constant of the yttrium-doped cerium structure is $0.0267 \mathrm{~h}^{-1}$, and the oxidation quantum efficiency is $0.3610 \%$, which is about twice that of the pure octahedral $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ structure. On this basis, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles doped with diverse concentrations of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ were compounded by molten salt method, since the ionic radius of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ is similar to that of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, it is easier to enter the lattice of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The photocatalytic activity and polishing properties of ceria nanoparticles doped with different concentrations of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ were evaluated. The optimal concentration of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doping was determined, and the PCMP mechanism of ceria nanoparticles was analyzed. For comparison, pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles were prepared without changing other preparation conditions.

### 2.2. Synthesis of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles

$\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles were synthesized by molten salt method. The synthesis steps are as follows: first, the source of cerium (Ce $\left.\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \bullet 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} ; \mathrm{Y}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \bullet 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}=1: 0.025 / 0.05 / 0.10 / 0.15\right)$ and molten salt $\left(\mathrm{KNO}_{3}: \mathrm{KCl}=0.905: 0.095\right)$ were weighed according to the experimental molar ratio of 1: 10. The weighed $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \bullet 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{Y}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \bullet 6$ $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{KCl}$ and $\mathrm{KNO}_{3}$ were fully ground in an agate mortar, anhydrous ethanol was added, and then the raw materials were stirred for 30 min at a rotating speed of $400 \mathrm{r} / \mathrm{min}$ with magnetic force to fully mix. The raw material was placed in an alumina crucible and dried in a remain unchanged temperature drying tunnel at $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to make all the anhydrous ethanol volatilize. Then, it was roasted in MF-1100 C-S Muffle furnace (Anhui Beick Equipment Technology Co., LTD) at $800^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 4 h (At the heating rate of $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{min}$, the temperature is heated to $800^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the heat is kept for 4 h , the temperature is cooled to $400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at $2^{\circ} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{min}$, and finally the natural cooling to room temperature.). The molten-salt ( $\mathrm{KNO}_{3}$-KCl) in the hybrid was eliminated with deionized water for $4-5$ times to obtain $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles at room temperature.

### 2.3. Photocatalytic activity test

A 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfect Light) was used to study the photocatalytic performance of tetracycline (TC). Before light irradiation, this was done by adding 25 mg of catalyst to TC solution ( 50 $\mathrm{mL}, 10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ ) and dark stirring for 60 min . The 3 mL suspension was drawn at a spacing interval and the supernatant was centrifugally derived in the course of the experiment. The concentration of TC in the supernatant was determined with UV-visible spectra photometer (P9, Shanghai Mapada Instrument). The characteristic absorption peak of TC is 357 nm .

### 2.4. Characterization

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the powder were recorded on D8 Advance diffractometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Regulus 8100, Hitachi) was used to observe the shape of powders in secondary electron mode. Circumstantial information of structure and shape was learned using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI

Tecnai G2 F20, USA). A Cary 5000 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies, USA) was used to record UV-visible diffuse reflection spectroscopy (UV-Vis DRS) to obtain band-gap energy. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with Al K $\alpha$ rays ( $\hbar v=1486.6 \mathrm{eV}$ ) as excitation source was used for elemental analysis at room temperature. The binding energy was calibrated by adsorbed carbon ( 284.8 eV ), and the peak area of the element was measured by semi-quantitative atomic ratio. The Raman microscope spectroscope (Raman, Renishaw in Via, UK) has recorded Raman spectrum nanoparticles with visible light at 532 nm .

### 2.5. Chemical mechanical polishing experiment

The self-made $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives were mixed in deionized water with a planetary ball mill, and were ground for 8 h at the speed of $390 \mathrm{r} /$ min. After complete dispersion, the solid content was adjusted to 0.5 wt $\%$ with deionized water. The pH was diluted to 6.0 by $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}$ solution and $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ solution. Before the CMP experiment began, the polishing slurry was stirred evenly with a magnetic stirrer. The quartz glass used in this experiment was purchased from Lianyungang Xiongtai Quartz Technology Co., LTD., with a thickness of 2 mm and a diameter of 20 mm . The automatic pressure grinding and polishing model used in the CMP experiment is UNIPOL-1200S, which was purchased from China Shenyang Kejing Automobile Instrument Co., LTD. Synthetic leather polishing pad is purchased from Shenyang Kejing Automobile Instrument Co., LTD., China. The polishing parameters were set to: the rotational speed of the polishing head was $80 \mathrm{r} / \mathrm{min}$, the antistrophic speed of the polishing platform was $80 \mathrm{r} / \mathrm{min}$, the total time of each polishing was 180 s , the flow rate of the polishing slurry was constant $25 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, and the maximum loading force exerted by the polishing head was 3.5 kg . At the same time, a 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfect Light) was used for photocatalysis to assist the CMP process. The distance between the light source and the sample is 20 cm , and the spectral range is $320-780 \mathrm{~nm}$.

The polished quartz glass was washed and dried repeatedly by washing combined with ultrasonic cleaning, and the properties of CMP were characterized. Seiko Instruments Inc. (AFM) was applied to survey the surface morphology of quartz glass and test its roughness at a scanning area of $5 \mu \mathrm{~m} \times 5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. The scanning mode was contact mode and the scanning rate was 1.0 Hz . The weight of the polished quartz glass was surveyed by using a precision electronic balance with an accuracy of 0.0001 g . The material removal rate (MRR, nm/min) used to characterize the polishing efficiency was calculated by Eq. (1) below [15]:
$M R R=\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{\rho \mathrm{At}}$
where $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ are respectively the weight of the quartz glass after and before chemical mechanical polishing, $\rho$ is the density of the quartz glass used in this experiment $\left(2.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\right)$, $t$ is the polishing time ( 180 s ), and $A$ is the area of the polished surface of the quartz glass $\left(3.14 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\right)$. In this experiment, the final MRR is the average of the three repeated experiments.

## 3. Results and discussion

The structural features of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles produced by molten salt method are shown in Fig. 1. All diffraction peaks are directed towards the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ phase with the face center cubic (FCC) crystal structure (JCPDS 34-0394) [33], [37]. In addition, no other diffraction peaks are found, indicating successful doping of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ into the cerium oxide lattice. Through further analysis of every diffraction peak, the structural variation trend of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ crystals synthesized with diverse $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doping amounts was obtained. The diffraction peak amplification results showed that the diffraction peaks shift to a lower angle with the rise of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doping amount, which meant that lattice parameters became larger.

Fig. 1. XRD pattern of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles in (a) full range and (b) certain range of fine scanning.

The possible reason is that with the introduction of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$, more $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ $(0.87 \mathrm{~nm})$ are converted into $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}(0.102 \mathrm{~nm})$. In $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ samples, $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doping resulted in the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ with a large ionic radius, resulting in lattice expansion. In order to achieve charge balance, more oxygen vacancies are generated at the same time. With the further increase of doping amount ( $\mathrm{x}=0.15$ ), because the ionic radius of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ is larger than that of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}(0.090 \mathrm{~nm})$, lattice shrinkage effect caused by $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doping and oxygen vacancy weakens the lattice expansion effect caused by $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, and as a result, the diffraction peak does not shift further to the lower angle.

Fig. 2 shows SEM images and granulometric distribution bars of pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles, respectively. The morphology of nanoparticles prepared with different $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doping amount has no significant difference. In the process of ultra-precision polishing, the morphology and size of abrasives have a great influence on its basic friction behavior and mechanical properties [38]. It can be further seen that the synthesized $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{x}=0,0.025,0.05,0.10,0.15)$ nanoparticles are nearly spherical. Pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particle size is about 187 nm . $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{x}=0.025,0.05,0.10,0.15)$ nanoparticles particle size is between 113 nm and 148 nm , the results indicating that the particle size of the material decreases slightly with the increase of doping amount. However, the difference in particle size is small. Thus, the influence of particle size on the performance of CMP and PCMP is reduced.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is an analytical method to identify the chemical state and composition on the materials' surface by measuring the excited photoelectron energy [39], [40]. It is used to study the chemical state and element content of the sample. Fig. 3(a) shows the samples' XPS spectra. The spectra shows that only $\mathrm{Ce}, \mathrm{Y}, \mathrm{C}$ and O elements are identified in the nanoparticles, while $\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{Na}$ and Cl elements do not exist, which also manifests that $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ is monophasic synthesis. Previous studies [41], [42], [43], [44], [45] have indicated that the cerium dioxide's chemical activity is bound up with $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration and oxygen vacancy concentration. For PCMP process, the higher $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive enhance its removal efficiency on $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate. Hence, the characteristic spectra of Ce 3 d is analyzed in detail. Generally, the spin orbits $3 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}$ and $3 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}$ are signed with $v$ and $u$, respectively. The characteristic peaks of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ are the peaks of $v_{0}, v^{\prime}, u_{0}$ and $u^{\prime}$, and the peaks of $v, v^{\prime \prime}, v^{\prime \prime \prime}, u, u^{\prime \prime}$ and $u^{\prime \prime \prime}$ are assigned to $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$. Therefore, the peaks of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ were identified by nonlinear peak fitting method, as shown in Fig. 3(b)-(f). The oxygen vacancy concentration of all samples synthesized in this study was sorted as follows: $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2}(39.0 \%)>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.15} \mathrm{O}_{2}(37.2 \%)>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Y}_{0.10} \mathrm{O}_{2}(37.0 \%)$ $>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.975} \mathrm{Y}_{0.025} \mathrm{O}_{2}(30.2 \%)>\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(23.3 \%)$. The concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ was shown in Fig. 3(g).

Table 1 shows the peak area data and binding energy of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles in diverse valence states of cerium. The concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ can be calculated by Eq. (2), and the integrated peak area was used for semi-quantitative analysis. It is calculated that the concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ is higher in the $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive.
$\frac{C e^{3+}}{C e^{3+}+C e^{4+}}=\frac{\operatorname{area}\left(v_{0}+v^{\prime}+u_{0}+u\right)}{\text { total area }}$
Fig. 4 shows the XPS spectra of O 1 s , and it can be matched with three peaks [41], [46], [47]. The peaks of $\mathrm{O} 1, \mathrm{O} 2$ and O 3 are lattice oxygen, vacancy adsorbed oxygen and surface adsorbed oxygen respectively. The samples' oxygen vacancy (Vo) concentration can be obtained by calculating a ratio that is the ratio of the area of peak O 2 to the sum of the areas of all the peaks. The oxygen vacancy concentration of all samples synthesized in this study was sorted as follows: $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ $(21.43 \%)>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.15} \mathrm{O}_{2} \quad(16.45 \%)>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Y}_{0.10} \mathrm{O}_{2} \quad(15.51 \%)$ $>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.975} \mathrm{Y}_{0.025} \mathrm{O}_{2}(13.48 \%)>\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(10.85 \%)$. More $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystal is reduced to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ to satisfy the charge balance due to the increased oxygen vacancy.

scattering effect. This method investigated the scattering spectra of incident light with various frequencies, and thus obtained the message about molecular rotation and vibration, which is used to the research of molecular structure. Raman characterization provides important analysis for the formation about oxygen vacancy in ceria materials. Fig. 5(a) shows the Raman spectrum of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ sample synthesized in this work. It can be observed that the strongest peak occurs at $-468 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ (denoted as $\mathrm{F}_{2 \mathrm{~g}}$ ), corresponding to the Raman active vibration mode.

This peak is due to the oxygen ions' symmetrical stretching in the cerium tetrahedral structure. Thus, the structural symmetry of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is maintained. Therefore, the peak will be very sensitive to the gaps/defects in the structure [48,49]. The doping of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ causes the distortion of the partial symmetry of the oxygen ion in the fluorite structure around the Ce ion, resulting in the formation of oxygen vacancy. The $\mathrm{F}_{2 \mathrm{~g}}$ peak redshifted with the increase of doping amount, which confirmed the existence of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ oxidation state in $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples. The red shift of

the spectrum is mainly attributed to the fact that $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ is reduced to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, which has a local electron in the 4 f state, resulting in a narrow band below the conduction band of the matrix material [48], [49]. There are also two bands within the Raman shift range of $500-650 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ (as shown in the illustration in Fig. 5(a)), which represent the generation of oxygen vacancy caused by rare earth doping. The appearance of Raman peaks (denoted as $\alpha$ ) around $560 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ is attributed to the production of external oxygen vacancies caused by charge neutral substitution of other trivalent rare earth cations into the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice. The peak around $610 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ (denoted as $\beta$ ) is thought to be an oxygen vacancy due to the presence of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ [50], [51]. Oxygen vacancy concentration can also be represented by the intensity ratio of $\left(\mathrm{I}_{4}+\mathrm{I}_{6}\right)$ to $\mathrm{I}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$. As shown in Fig. 5 (b), the oxygen vacancy concentration of all samples synthesized in this study was sorted as follows: $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2}(0.1726)>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.85} \mathrm{Y}_{0.15} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ $(0.1087)>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.90} \mathrm{Y}_{0.10} \mathrm{O}_{2}(0.1045)>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.975} \mathrm{Y}_{0.025} \mathrm{O}_{2}(0.1023)>\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ $(0.0414)$, indicating that compared with pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, the oxygen vacancy
concentration of Y -doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ increased significantly. More oxygen vacancies were generated when the doping amount was 0.05 .

The ultraviolet-visible spectrum of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles (Fig. 6 (a)) shows a strong absorption peak occurs at about 340 nm , owing to the electron transition from O 2 p level to Ce 4 f level. In order to acquire the band-gap width (bg) of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples, Schuster-Kubelka-Munk absorption function ( $a b v$ ) and photon energy ( $h v$ ) were plotted as follows according to Eq. (3):
$(a b v)^{*}=\mathrm{K}\left(\mathrm{h} v-\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{x}}\right)$
Where $v$ is the vibration frequency, $h$ is Planck's constant, $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient, $h v$ is the photon energy, and $K$ is the proportionality constant. The type of semiconductor determines the value of $\mathrm{n} . \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is the indirect transition semiconductor. Consequently, $n$ is equal to $1 / 2$. The rough band gap can be calibrated by measuring the X-intercept of

the line, as shown in Fig. 6(b). The Eg of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{x}=0,0.025,0.05$, $0.10,0.15)$ samples were equal to $3.09 \mathrm{eV}, 3.02 \mathrm{eV}, 2.84 \mathrm{eV}, 2.97 \mathrm{eV}$ and 2.90 eV , respectively. The $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples' band gap was narrowed in different degrees. Among them, $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ has the narrowest band gap. The reason for the band gap's narrowing is owing to the heighten of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice. After Y doping, the band gap first decreases and then increases with the enhancement of doping amount, consistent with the XPS test results.

The photocatalytic performance of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles was characterized by photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline TC. Fig. 7 (a)-(d) shows the TC degradation curve and its pseudo-first-order kinetic curve. Before the photocatalytic experiment, dark adsorption was carried out for 60 min , to avert the influence of particle surface attach on TC degradation performance, and then ultraviolet irradiation was
carried out. As shown in Fig. 7(a) and (c), after ultraviolet irradiation for 60 min , the photodegradation efficiency of TC solution was calculated as $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2}(80.4 \%)>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.85} \mathrm{Y}_{0.15} \mathrm{O}_{2}(78.8 \%)>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.90} \mathrm{Y}_{0.10} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ $(76.5 \%)>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.975} \mathrm{Y}_{0.025} \mathrm{O}_{2}(72.9 \%)>\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(65.7 \%)$. The reaction kinetic constants of TC photodegradation process can be computed as follows (4):
$k t=-\ln \left(\frac{C_{t}}{C_{0}}\right)$
Where, $k, t, C_{0}$ and $C_{t}$ are respectively the reaction kinetic constant, light irradiation time, initial concentration after dark adsorption and residual concentration under a certain irradiation time. As shown as Fig. 7(b) and (d), the k of the calculated samples was as follows: $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2}$

${ }^{1}$ ). Among them, the $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles doped with $5 \% \mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ shows better photodegradation activity, associated with the increase of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy in the sample, and it is the same as the XPS test results.

In this work, the impedance spectra are fitted by means of equivalent circuits, as shown in Fig. 8(a). The circuit used is the same as that used by Debarati Das et al. [52] doped ions of different sizes in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ for catalytic reaction. Impedance spectra can be fitted by the equivalent circuits with two diverse time constants, as shown in the illustration in Fig. 8(a). In this circuit, Q represents the generalized capacitance of the catalyst. $\mathrm{R}_{1}$ represents the electrolyte resistance between the reference electrode and the working electrode. $\mathrm{R}_{2}$ corresponds to the resistance of the catalyst itself. $\mathrm{R}_{3}$ is known as the electron transfer resistance for photocatalytic processes. $\mathrm{C}_{3}$ is defined as the double layer capacitance on the catalyst surface. Therefore, the equivalent circuit takes into account both the effect of solution resistance between the reference electrode and the working electrode and the relative change of the interface between the working electrode and the electrolyte, which perfectly characterizes our experimental observations. The semicircle represents the integral of all the resistance parameters. The charge transfer resistance $\left(R_{3}\right)$ obtained by fitting the equivalent circuit changes significantly with the change of the element and its doping level. The results show that the sample $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ has the smallest semicircle, the largest current and the smallest overpotential. $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ sample has the smallest electron transfer resistance, suggesting that for all doping samples in this work, the $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ sample has the smallest obstacle and the best catalytic performance in the photocatalytic reaction, and the content of oxygen vacancy and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ on the sample surface contribute to the improvement of the photocatalytic performance.

The photocurrent response of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ was recorded under visible light, as shown in Fig. 8(b). Obvious on-off and off-cycle photocurrent was observed. For all doped samples in this study, the photocurrent response of $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ was significantly improved, and the photocurrent density was about several times that of other samples. It is well known that the strong light current density means that the photogenerated electron-hole pair has a higher separation efficiency when other parameters are constant [53]. It can be seen that the doping amount of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ is 0.05 , which can effectively promote the separation rate of photogenerated carrier in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$.

MRR is one of the crucial adjective indexes in evaluating abrasive polishing performance. Fig. 9 is the MRR curve of quartz glass with the polished slurry containing $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles. The doping of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ increases the MRR of PCMP and CMP, and decreases with the further increase of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doping. When the doping amount is $5 \%$, the MRR of the abrasive in PCMP and CMP is $636.40 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ and $473.17 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$,

respectively. Through the previous characterization test, we can know that the surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration of pure abrasive particles is relatively small, and its chemical activity is not high. Therefore, in the chemical-mechanical polishing process of this experiment, the MRR of the polishing slurry prepared by pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles is not optimistic. The XPS results in Fig. 3 show that Y doping can increase the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration of cerium oxide. Figs. 7 and 8 show that it can increase the chemical activity of the abrasive, thereby increasing the MRR. The MRR of $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ is the best MRR among the doped abrasive particles. The variation trend of doping abrasive MRR was the same as that of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration.

The surface performance of the workpiece to be polished is also a crucial parameter to evaluate the polishing performance of the abrasive/polishing slurry. Fig. 10 shows the characterization of the surface morphology of quartz glass by atomic force microscopy. Fig. 10(a)-(k) shows the 2-dimensional (2D) surface morphology of quartz glass before and after chemical-mechanical polishing. Dark areas show valleys, and light areas show peaks. Furthermore, the contour roughness of the diagonal selection area in Fig. 10(a), (g)-(k) was measured. As shown in Fig. 10(l), where the X-axis represents the length of the line outline, and the Z-axis is labeled with its depth. The improvement in surface smoothness can be demonstrated by the reduction of topographic variation. In addition, the rough peaks and valleys on all polished surfaces are more evenly distributed than on unpolished original quartz glass surfaces, which helps improve the overall surface quality.

shows the mean surface roughness (Ra) curve of after CMP and PCMP. The initial roughness of quartz glass is 1.08 nm . The surface quality of polished quartz glass was improved and the surface roughness was reduced after CMP and PCMP treatment with polishing slurry containing $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives. Compared with pure abrasives, the surface is flatter after polishing with doped abrasives. In the range of $5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ $\times 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, the surface roughness Ra value is 0.16 nm , and the surface quality is significantly improved, indicating that the prepared $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive has a good polishing effect on quartz glass when the doping amount of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ is 0.05 . With the further increase of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doping amount, the roughness increases slightly. This is because the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration of the abrasive becomes smaller, thus reducing the chemical activity and weakening the chemical action. The result is that the chemical reaction rate cannot keep up with the mechanical removal rate, resulting in poor surface quality. As can be seen from Fig. 10(a)-(k), the surface of the $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ polished quartz glass is smooth without scratches, indicating that a small surface roughness can be obtained on

the basis of ensuring a large material removal rate. Table 2 is MRR and roughness comparison table of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles. The MRR and Ra of abrasives synthesized with different doping amounts can be quantified by this table.

In this work, $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doping increased the content of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ on nanoparticle surface and enhanced the photocatalytic activity of abrasives. The removal efficiency of abrasives was further improved based on photocatalysis. Fig. 11 shows the PCMP mechanism of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives on quartz glass. In the PCMP, $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles absorb the photon energy generated by ultraviolet irradiation. The photoelectron ( $\mathrm{e}^{-}$) is excited to make the transition to the conduction band (CB) from the valence band (VB), generating an oxidation site ( $\mathrm{h}^{+}$) in VB and a reduction site ( $\mathrm{e}^{-}$) in CB. Photo-generative electron-hole ( $\mathrm{e}^{-} \cdot \mathrm{h}^{+}$) pairs are formed, as shown in Fig. 11(a). Photo-generative carriers can react with the surrounding medium to produce oxidizing active groups, such as superoxide free radicals $\left(\cdot \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$, hydroxyl free radicals $(\cdot \mathrm{OH}), \mathrm{h}^{+}$, etc. In the Y -doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ can produce impurity level in the forbidden band of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, which reduces the band width. The objective of this strategy is to form a receptor layer below CB of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ to promote electron flow downward from $\mathrm{CeO}_{2} \mathrm{CB}$ to the doping layer, thereby inhibiting the recombination of photo-generative carriers. After the doping of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ into the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice, the exposed $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ were partially replaced by $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$. The resulting oxygen vacancy can effectively trap electrons in CB and limit the speed of photo-generative carrier recombination in Y -doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. Therefore, the $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles have better photocatalytic activities.

A large contact area and uniform stress distribution can be obtained by installing polished quartz glass on the surface of the indenter and applying downward pressure. The $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate and $\cdot \mathrm{OH}$ in the polishing slurry contact and hydration reaction occurs, $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH}$ bond is formed on the surface of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate, and $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ hydration layer is generated. Those active substances of the polishing slurry are thought to offer additional strong oxidizing activity, which in turn accelerates the production of chemical reaction layers. It is generally believed that the improvement of chemical reaction activity of slurry helps the surface of quartz glass to be polished to form more quickly and easily removed hydration layer, thus improving MRR. At the same time, the surface of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ was dissociated by $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to form the -OH group, and silicate ions were adsorbed to the surface of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ through the interaction with the -OH group, as shown in Fig. 11(b).

Cook [54] proposed that the material removal was due to the mechanical action of abrasive nanoparticles flowing with the polishing fluid pressed into the surface of Si sheet, and showed that the chemical action of the material removal process in the chemical-mechanical polishing of Si sheet depended on the interaction between the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ layer and nanoparticles generated on the surface of Si and the water and chemical agent in the polishing slurry. In this work, $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions can be used as the active site on the surface of ceria and react with the glass surface to form Ce-O-Si bonds, as shown in Fig. 11(c). The strength of the new bond is stronger than that of the Si-O-Si bond on the surface of molten silica. Under the mechanical force exerted by the polishing machine. The Si-O-Si bond was broken. The polished quartz glass surface was removed, as shown in Fig. 11(d). In the case of polished silica, it is generally considered that the high concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ on the surface of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives is responsible for the high reactivity with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ matrix. It was covered in literature [29], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62] that $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives rich in $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ obtained significant removal capacity, which may be due to the enhanced tribological chemical activity to the quartz glass (accelerates the becoming of Ce-O-Si bonds). The MRR of the developed $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive under PCMP condition is significantly higher than that under the CMP condition, which may be caused by the enhancement of the
photocatalytic activity of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ polishing slurry under UV irradiation.

## 4. Conclusions

In this experiment, a series of near-spherical, Y-doped $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles with the size of about $113-148 \mathrm{~nm}$ were produced by a convenient molten salt method. Ion doping was used for regulating the defect concentration and increase the chemical activity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles. The results showed that ion doping was beneficial to improve the concentration of oxygen vacancy and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles, and thus improved the photocatalytic oxidation activity, among which $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.5} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles had the highest concentrations of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy. The results showed that the MRR of Y-doped cerium oxide PCMP was higher than that of its CMP, and the performance of $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.95} \mathrm{Y}_{0.5} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticle was the best ( $M R R=636.40 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}, R \mathrm{a}=$ 0.16 nm ). Compared with pure abrasive particles, the surface quality of quartz glass was effectively improved while ensuring high MRR. The PCMP mechanism of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles was further analyzed. This work promotes the research, the development and application of ceria nanoparticles in the field of photocatalysis and CMP.
