CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS
[0001] This application is a divisional application of U.S. application Ser. No. 14/785,014, pending, which was filed Oct. 16, 2015, in the United States Patent and Trademark Office as a National Stage entry from International Application No. PCT/KR2014/003367, filed Apr. 17, 2014, which published as WO 2014/171766 on Oct. 23, 2014; Korean Patent Application No. 10-2013-0042551, filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Apr. 17, 2013; and Korean Patent Application No. 10-2014-0045953, filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Apr. 17, 2014, the entire disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference.

## TECHNICAL FIELD

[0002] The present invention relates to a CMP slurry composition for organic films and a polishing method using the same.

## BACKGROUND ART

[0003] A method for producing a semiconductor includes a process of forming an inorganic film for example a silicon oxide film or a silicon nitride film on a patterned silicon wafer and a process of gap-filling via-holes formed in the inorganic film. The gap-filling process is performed to fill the via-holes with organic film materials, after the gap-filling process, a planarization process is performed to remove excess of the organic film. For planarization process, polishing by CMP (chemical mechanical polishing) attracts attention in the art.
[0004] A typical CMP slurry composition for organic films includes polymer polishing particles in order to allow the organic films to be polished at a high polishing amount per unit time without deterioration in surface conditions such as scratches. However, since the organic films are not made of the same material, the typical CMP slurry composition fails to achieve a desired polishing amount while enhancing a degree of planarization on a polished surface, with respect to some kind of organic film. Moreover, when a metal oxide abrasive used in polishing of metal films such as silicon and the like is used in polishing of the organic films, it is difficult achieve a desired polishing amount with respect to some kind of organic film, and/or the degree of planarization on a polished surface is lowered due to scratches and the like.

[0013] As used herein, the term "functional group including $\mathrm{P}^{\prime \prime}$ may be represented by Formula A, and the term "functional group including B" may be represented by Formula B:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { *-(O)n-( } \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{im}-\mathrm{P}(=\mathrm{O})(\mathrm{R})(\mathrm{R}) \\
& \text { *--B(R)(R') }
\end{aligned}
$$

[0014] (wherein in Formula A and Formula B, n is 0 or 1 , m is an integer from 0 to 10 ,
[0015] R, R' are each independently, hydrogen, a hydroxyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C 1 to C 20 alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C 2 to C 20 alkenyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C 3 to C 20 cycloalkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C 1 to C 20 haloalkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C 1 to C 20 alkylsulfonate group, a substituted or unsubstituted C 1 to C 20 alkylsulfonyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C 2 to C 20 alkylamide group, a substituted or unsubstituted C3 to C20 alkylester group, a substituted or unsubstituted C2 to C20 cyanoalkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C 1 to C 20 alkoxy group, a substituted or unsubstituted C 6 to C 30 aryl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C 6 to C 30 arylalkyl group, or a substituted or unsubstituted C 6 to C 30 aryloxy group, or [0016] R, R' are linked to each other to form a substituted or unsubstituted C 3 to C 20 cycloalkyl group or a substituted or unsubstituted C3 to C20 heterocycloalkyl group).
[0017] Preferably, the "functional group including $\mathrm{P}^{\prime \prime}$ is a functional group including P and O , for example, $-\mathrm{P}(=\mathrm{O})$ $(\mathrm{OH})_{2}, \quad-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{P}(=\mathrm{O})(\mathrm{OH})_{2}, \quad-\mathrm{P}(=\mathrm{O})\left(\mathrm{OCH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{2}$, $-\mathrm{P}(=\mathrm{O})\left(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{4} \mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}\right)\left(\mathrm{OCH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)$, and the like, for instance, the "functional group including B" is a functional group including B and O , for example, $-\mathrm{B}(\mathrm{OH})_{2},-\mathrm{B}(\mathrm{H})$ $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right),-\mathrm{B}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)_{2}$.
[0018] When an inorganic film is deposited on a patterned wafer, fur example, a patterned silicon wafer, an organic film fills via-holes formed therein. The CMP slurry composition must be capable of polishing an organic film at a sufficient polishing rate in order to planarize the deposited film and be capable of increasing the degree of planarization on the polished surface, after polishing, the residue remaining on the inorganic film must be easily removable. The inorganic film may be film formed with at least one of silicon oxide and silicon nitride, without being limited thereto.
[0019] The organic film may have significantly different polishing amounts per unit time and the degree of planarization after polishing, depending upon the materials for the organic film.
[0020] The CMP slurry composition for organic films according to the present invention is a composition for polishing an organic film having high carbon content. When the CMP slurry composition of the present invention is used for polishing the organic film, it is possible to enhance the polishing amount of the organic film per unit time and the degree of planarization of the organic film and to facilitate removal of residues from the inorganic film after polishing.
[0021] As a polishing target, the organic film according to the present invention has relatively higher values in terms of
carbon content, film density and hardness, than typical organic films, and thus cannot be polished using a typical CMP slurry composition for organic films including polymer particles. On the contrary, the CMP slurry composition according to the present invention is capable of polishing the organic film at a high polishing amount of the organic film per unit time without deteriorating surface conditions due to scratches. Specifically, the polishing amount of the organic film per unit time is about $500 \AA / \mathrm{min}$ or more, for example, about $1,000 \AA / \mathrm{min}$ or more, for example, about 500 to 5000 $\AA / \mathrm{min}$. Within this range, a desired polishing amount can be secured.
[0022] In one embodiment, the organic film may have a carbon content from about 50 atom $\%$ to 95 atom $\%$, for example, from about 65 atom $\%$ to 95 atom $\%$, or, for example, from about 70 atom $\%$ to 92 atom $\%$, such as about 65 atom $\%, 66$ atom $\%, 67$ atom $\%, 68$ atom $\%, 69$ atom $\%$, 70 atom $\%, 71$ atom $\%, 72$ atom $\%, 73$ atom $\%, 74$ atom $\%$, 75 atom $\%, 76$ atom $\%, 77$ atom $\%$, 78 atom $\%, 79$ atom $\%$, 80 atom $\%, 81$ atom $\%, 82$ atom $\%, 83$ atom $\%, 84$ atom $\%$, 85 atom $\%, 86$ atom $\%, 87$ atom $\%, 88$ atom $\%$, 89 atom $\%$, 90 atom $\%, 91$ atom $\%, 92$ atom $\%$, 93 atom $\%, 94$ atom $\%$, or 95 atom $\%$. Within this range, when the organic film is polished using a metal oxide abrasive, the polishing amount is high, there is no scratching, and the degree of planarization on the polished surface is high. The organic film may have a film density from about $0.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to $2.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$, for example, from about $1.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to $2.0 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$, for example, from about $1.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to $1.6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$; for example, about 0.5 $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 0.6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 0.7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 0.8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 0.9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 1.0$ $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 1.1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 1.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 1.3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 1.4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 1.5$ $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 1.6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 1.7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 1.8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 1.9 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 2.0$ $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 2.1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 2.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 2.3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, 2.4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$, or $2.5$ $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$. Within this range, when the organic film is polished using a metal oxide abrasive, the polishing amount is high, there is no scratching, and the degree of planarization on the polished surface is high. The organic film may have a hardness of about 0.4 GPa or more, for example, about 1.0 GPa or more, for example, about 1.3 GPa , or more, for example, from about 1.0 GPa to 1.5 GPa , for example, about $0.4 \mathrm{GPa}, 0.5 \mathrm{GPa}, 0.6 \mathrm{GPa}, 0.7 \mathrm{GPa}, 0.8 \mathrm{GPa}, 0.9 \mathrm{GPa}, 1.0$ GPa, $1.1 \mathrm{GPa}, 1.2 \mathrm{GPa}, 1.3 \mathrm{GPa}, 1.4 \mathrm{GPa}$, or 1.5 GPa . Within this range, when the organic film is polished using a metal oxide abrasive, the polishing amount is high, there is no scratching, and the degree of planarization on the polished surface is high.
[0023] Further, the organic film according to the present invention may have an acid value of substantially about 0 $\mathrm{mgKOH} / \mathrm{g}$. In the case of polishing the organic film using the prior CMP slurry composition for organic films including a polymer abrasive, there is a problem in that the polishing rate is lowered. On the contrary, the CMP slurry composition according to the present invention has a merit that the polishing amount of the organic film per unit time applicable to the CMP process can be secured. The term "substantially" includes the cases where the acid value is not only 0 $\mathrm{mgKOH} / \mathrm{g}$ but also $0 \mathrm{mgKOH} / \mathrm{g}$ with an acceptable margin of error.
[0024] Specifically, the organic film according to the present invention may be produced by applying a composition including a compound having a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group to an inorganic film, followed by baking at high temperature, for example, at about $200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. to $400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

[0025] The term "compound having a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group" refers to a compound which is not decomposed after baking and allows an organic film formed of the composition to have high carbon content. The unsubstituted aromatic group refers to a single or fused polycyclic aromatic group having C 6 to C 100 , for example, C6 to C50. More particularly, the unsubstituted aromatic group may include units represented by Formulae 1-1 to $1-26$ :

[0056] The organic film composition according to the third embodiment is substantially the same as the organic film composition according to the first embodiment except that the organic film composition according to the third embodiment includes the polymer containing aromatic groups instead of the material comprising Formula 2, as the compound having a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group. The following is a description of the polymer containing aromatic groups.
[0057] The polymer containing aromatic groups may increase carbon content, film density and hardness of the organic film formed after baking the organic film composition. The polymer containing aromatic groups may be produced by a typical method. A detailed process for producing the polymer can found in Korean Patent No. 10-0908601.
[0058] In a fourth embodiment, a composition for forming the organic film may include at least two of the material comprising Formula 2; the material represented by Formula 6 ; and the polymers containing aromatic groups selected from (i), (ii), and (iii), as the compounds having a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group. The composition for forming the organic film according to the fourth embodiment is substantially the same as the composition for forming the organic film according to the first embodiment except that the organic film composition according to the fourth embodiment includes at least two the compounds having a substituted or unsubstituted aromatic group.
[0059] Next, a CMP slurry composition for organic films according to one embodiment of the present invention will be described.
[0060] The CMP slurry composition for organic films according to one embodiment of the present invention may include at least one of polar solvents and non-polar solvents; and a metal oxide abrasive, and may be acidic. As a result, the composition can polish the organic film of the present invention at a high polishing amount without scratching and can increase the degree of planarization on a polished surface.
[0061] The polar and/or non-polar solvents may serve to reduce friction when the organic film having high carbon content is polished with the metal oxide abrasive. Examples of the polar and/or non-polar solvents may include water, for example, ultrapurified water, organic amines, organic alcohols, organic alcohol amines, organic ethers, organic ketones, and the like. For example, ultrapurified water may be used as the polar and/or non-polar solvents. The polar

and/or non-polar solvents may be present in the balance amount in the CMP slurry composition.
[0062] The metal oxide abrasive may serve to polish the organic film having high carbon content, high film density and high hardness at a high polishing amount. Specifically, the metal oxide abrasive may enhance the degree of planarization on the polished surface without scratching when the organic film according to the present invention is polished with the metal oxide abrasive. More specifically, the metal oxide abrasive may include at least one of silica, alumina, ceria, titania, and zirconia.. Particularly, silica may have better dispersion stability. Ceria may provide a high polishing rate even in the case where an oxidant is absent or present in an extremely small amount in the slurry composition.
[0063] The metal oxide abrasive is composed of spherical particles and has an average particle size from about 10 nm to about 150 nm , for example, from about 30 nm to 70 nm , for example, about $30 \mathrm{~nm}, 35 \mathrm{~nm}, 40 \mathrm{~nm}, 45 \mathrm{~nm}, 50 \mathrm{~nm}, 55$ $\mathrm{nm}, 60 \mathrm{~nm}, 65 \mathrm{~nm}$, or 70 nm . Within this range, the metal oxide abrasive can secure a sufficient polishing rate with respect the organic film of the present invention without scratching and enhance the degree of planarization.
[0064] The metal oxide abrasive is present in an amount of about $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $20 \mathrm{wt} \%$, for example about $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $15 \mathrm{wt} \%$, for example, about $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $5 \mathrm{wt} \%$, for example, about $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.2 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.3 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.4 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.5$ $\mathrm{wt} \%, 0.6 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.7 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.8 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.9 \mathrm{wt} \%, 1 \mathrm{wt} \%, 1.1$ $\mathrm{wt} \%, 1.2 \mathrm{wt} \%, 1.3 \mathrm{wt} \%, 1.4 \mathrm{wt} \%, 1.5 \mathrm{wt} \%, 1.6 \mathrm{wt} \%$, $1.7 \mathrm{wt} \%, 1.8 \mathrm{wt} \%, 1.9 \mathrm{wt} \%, 2 \mathrm{wt} \%, 2.1 \mathrm{wt} \%, 2.2 \mathrm{wt} \%$, $2.3 \mathrm{wt} \%, 2.4 \mathrm{wt} \%, 2.5 \mathrm{wt} \%, 2.6 \mathrm{wt} \%, 2.7 \mathrm{wt} \%, 2.8 \mathrm{wt}$ $\%, 2.9 \mathrm{wt} \%, 3 \mathrm{wt} \%, 3.1 \mathrm{wt} \%, 3.2 \mathrm{wt} \%, 3.3 \mathrm{wt} \%, 3.4 \mathrm{wt}$ $\%, 3.5 \mathrm{wt} \%, 3.6 \mathrm{wt} \%, 3.7 \mathrm{wt} \%, 3.8 \mathrm{wt} \%, 3.9 \mathrm{wt} \%, 4 \mathrm{wt}$ $\%, 4.1 \mathrm{wt} \%, 4.2 \mathrm{wt} \%, 4.3 \mathrm{wt} \%, 4.4 \mathrm{wt} \%, 4.5 \mathrm{wt} \%, 4.6$ $\mathrm{wt} \%, 4.7 \mathrm{wt} \%, 4.8 \mathrm{wt} \%, 4.9 \mathrm{wt} \%$, or $5 \mathrm{wt} \%$, in the CMP slurry composition. Within this content range of the metal oxide abrasive, the slurry composition can secure a sufficient polishing rate with respect the organic film of the present invention without scratching and enhance the dispersion stability. Preferably, the slurry composition secures an enhanced polishing rate with respect to the organic film and a low polishing rate with respect to an inorganic film by increasing the average particle size of the metal oxide abrasive while reducing the content of the metal oxide abrasive in the slurry composition.
[0065] The CMP slurry composition may be acidic and thus has high polishing selectivity ratio of the organic film over the inorganic film, and can enhance the polishing amount per unit time with respect to the organic film and the degree of planarization. Specifically, the CMP slurry composition may have a pH value of about 6 or less, for example, about 5 or less, for example, 1 to 5 , for example, about 1.0 , $1.1,1.2,1.3,1.4,1.5,1.6,1.7,1.8,1.9,2,2.1,2.2,2.3,2.4$, $2.5,2.6,2.7,2.8,2.9,3,3.1,3.2,3.3,3.4,3.5,3.6,3.7,3.8$, $3.9,4,4.1,4.2,4.3,4.4,4.5,4.6,4.7,4.8,4.9$, or 5 . The pH of the CMP slurry composition according to one embodiment of the present invention may be adjusted in this range of pH using, for example, a pH adjusting agent. Examples of the pH adjusting agent may include an inorganic acid, for example, at least one of nitric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, and sulfuric acid, and an organic acid, for example, an organic acid having a pKa value of 6 or less, for example, at least one of acetic acid and citric acid, without being limited thereto.
[0066] The CMP slurry composition may further include an additive. For example, the CMP slurry composition may further include a polishing accelerator as an additive. The polishing accelerator suppresses the polishing rate of the inorganic film, thereby increasing polishing selectivity ratio of the organic film over the inorganic film. The polishing accelerator may include at least one of organic acids such as malic acid, citric acid, formic acid, glutaric acid, oxalic acid, phthalic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, and malonic acid. The polishing accelerator may be present in an amount of about $0.02 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $0.5 \mathrm{wt} \%$ in the CMP slurry composition. Within this range, the composition has no detrimental effect on the polishing rate, dispersion stability of the slurries, and surface properties of organic carbon films.
[0067] The CMP slurry composition may further include a pH adjusting agent in order to make the pH of the composition acidic. The pH adjusting agent may be present in an amount such that the pH of the slurry composition can be suitably adjusted, thereby increasing polishing selectivity of the organic film over the inorganic film.
[0068] Hereinafter, a CMP slurry composition for organic films according to another embodiment of the present invention will be described.
[0069] The CMP slurry composition for organic films according to another embodiment may include a polar and/or non-polar solvent, a metal oxide abrasive, and an oxidant, and thus may be acidic. As compared with the CMP slurry composition for organic films according to the one embodiment, the CMP slurry composition according to the another embodiment may further include an oxidant, thereby increasing polishing selectivity ratio of the organic film over the inorganic film, the polishing rate of the organic film, and the degree of planarization on the polished surface. The CMP slurry composition according to this embodiment is substantially the same as the CMP slurry composition according to the one embodiment except that the CMP slurry composition according to this embodiment further includes the oxidant. The following is a description for the oxidant.
[0070] In order to facilitate polishing of the organic carbon film having high carbon content, high film density and high hardness, the oxidant oxidizes a surface layer of the organic film to facilitate polishing of the organic film. When the inorganic film is exposed by polishing, the oxidant can make the surface of the organic film smooth, thereby improving roughness of the organic film even after polishing. Further, the oxidant facilitates removal of residues of the organic film remaining on the inorganic film, thereby securing uniform polishing.
[0071] Specifically, the oxidant may include at least one of metal salts in a multivalent oxidation state and transition metal chelates. As used herein, the term "multivalent" refers to divalent or higher, for example, trivalent or higher, for example, tetravalent or higher.
[0072] The metal salts in a multivalent oxidation state are capable of increasing the polishing rate of the organic film while reducing the polishing rate of the inorganic film. The metal salts may include metals such as transition metals, lanthanides, and the like, and may further include halogen, ammonium, nitrate, and the like. Specifically, the metal salts may include ceric ammonium salts, ferric halogen salts, ferric nitrate salts, and the like. For example, the metal salts may include ceric ammonium nitrate, ferric nitrate, ferric chloride, and the like.

[0073] The transition metal chelates can increase the polishing rate of the organic film while reducing the polishing rate of the inorganic film.
[0074] In the transition metal chelates, the transition metals include typical transition metals belonging to Group III to Group XII of the periodic table, for example, iron, copper, manganese, or chromium. Examples of chelates may include oxalic acid, a carboxylic acid substituted with an amino group (for example, aminopolycarboxylate such as iminodiacetic acid, ethylenediaminedisuccinic acid, iminodisuccinic acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, nitrilotriacetic acid; alpha-amino acid such as glycine, beta-amino acid), a carboxylic acid substituted with a hydroxyl group (for example, polycarboxylic acids containing a hydroxyl group such as glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid), phosphonocarboxylic acid, aminophosphonic acid, and combinations thereof. Examples of the transition metal chelates may include at least one of Fe -containing compounds such as propylene diamine tetraacetic acid-Fe and the like, and Mn -containing compounds such as propylene diamine tetraacetic acid-Mn and the like, without being limited thereto.
[0075] The oxidant may be present in an amount of about $0.001 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $15 \mathrm{wt} \%$ in the CMP slurry composition, for example, about $0.01 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $5 \mathrm{wt} \%$, for example, about 0.05 $\mathrm{wt} \%$ to $3 \mathrm{wt} \%$, for example, about $0.05 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$, $0.15 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.2 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.25 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.3 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.35 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.4$ $\mathrm{wt} \%, 0.45 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.5 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.55 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.6 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.65 \mathrm{wt}$ $\%, 0.7 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.8 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.85 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.9 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.95 \mathrm{wt} \%, 1$ $\mathrm{wt} \%, 1.5 \mathrm{wt} \%, 2 \mathrm{wt} \%, 2.5 \mathrm{wt} \%$, or $3 \mathrm{wt} \%$. Within this range of the oxidant, the CMP slurry composition can maintain suitable etching ability with respect to the organic film. The CMP slurry composition may be acidic and improve stability of the oxidant, thereby enhancing the polishing rate of the organic film, the degree of planarization on the polished surface, and polishing selectivity ratio of the organic film over the inorganic film.
[0076] Next, a method of polishing an organic film according to the present invention will be described.
[0077] The method for polishing an organic film according to the present invention may include polishing an organic film having high carbon content, high film density and high hardness using the CMP slurry composition for organic films according to the present invention, The CMP slurry composition may include CMP slurry compositions for organic films according to the emdodiments of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 1, (a) shows a stack structure of a silicon wafer, an inorganic film, and an organic carbon film before polishing. A silicon wafer $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ is subjected to patterning to have an engraved portion thereon, followed by deposition of an inorganic film $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ on the silicon wafer $\mathbf{1 0 0}$. Then, an organic carbon film $\mathbf{1 2 0}$ is deposited on the inorganic film, followed by baking at about $200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. to about $400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. to form the stack structure. In FIG. 1(a), T indicates a virtual polishing stop line. A CMP slurry composition is applied to the organic film shown in FIG. 1(a), followed by placing a polishing pad thereon and rotating the silicon wafer $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ to polish the stack structure. Polishing is performed until the wafer reaches the polishing stop line T, as shown in FIG. $\mathbf{1}(b)$.
[0078] Next, the present invention will be described in more detail with reference to the following examples. These examples are provided for illustration only and are not to be construed in any way as limiting the present invention.

## Mode for Invention

## PREPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1

[0079] A 2000 ml three-necked flask provided with a thermometer, a condenser, a mechanical stirrer and a dropping funnel was dipped in an oil bath at $140^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Heating and stirring by a magnet were performed on a hot plate, and cooling water was set to $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C} .220 \mathrm{~g}(1 \mathrm{~mol})$ of 1 -methoxy pyrene was placed in the flask, followed by adding 138 g ( 1.0 mol ) of 1,4 -bismethoxymethylbenzene, which in turn was dissolved in 656 g of propyleneglycol monomethyletheracetate. Thereafter, 4.6 g ( 0.03 mol ) of diethyl sulfate was added to the solution. The temperature of the flask was maintained at $130^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. A reaction completion point was determined by measuring the molecular weight of the reactant at certain time intervals during polymerization. Samples for measuring the molecular weight were prepared by cooling 1 g of the reactant to room temperature, obtaining 0.02 g of the mixture therefrom, followed by diluting the reactant with tetrahydrofuran such that the solid content was $4 \mathrm{wt} \%$. In order to finish reaction at a predetermined reaction completion point, 4.48 g ( 0.03 mol ) of triethanolamine was added as a neutralizing agent to the flask, followed by stirring. Subsequently, the reactant was slowly cooled to room temperature. The reactant was diluted with 500 g of propyleneglycolmonomethyletheracetate. Next, a solvent was added to a 2000 ml separation funnel. 4 kg of a mixture of methanol and ethylene glycol in a ratio of $90: 10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{g}$ was prepared. The synthesized polymer solution was dropped into the alcohol mixture under severe stirring. The resultant polymer was harvested from the bottom of the flask and the supernatant was separately stored. After removing the supernatant, methanol was removed from the final reactant in a rotary evaporator at $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. for 10 minutes under reduced pressure.

mol) of trichloroaluminium in 1000 g of toluene was added to a 2 L four-necked flask provided with a mechanical stirrer and a condenser, followed by stirring the solution with the stirrer and reacting for 10 hours. After completion of the reaction, trichloroaluminium was removed from the reactant using water. $37.83 \mathrm{~g}(1.0 \mathrm{~mol})$ of sodium borohydride was added to the obtained compound and then reaction was carried out for 17 hours. Upon completion of the reaction, by-products were removed using a water/methanol mixture to obtain a compound represented by :Formula 11 (average molecular weight: $530 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}, 1 \mathrm{~m} 1+\mathrm{n} 2+\mathrm{n} 3+\mathrm{n} 4+\mathrm{n} 5+\mathrm{n} 6 \mathrm{a} 6$ ).
![img-37.jpeg](images\img-37.jpeg)
[0084] 0.8 g of the compound represented by Formula 11 was dissolved in 9 g of propyleneglycolmonomethyletheracetate, followed by filtering the solution to produce a composition for organic films.

In order to fill the engraved pattern formed on the surface of the silica film, an organic film was formed to a thickness of $2650 \AA$. The organic film was produced by applying the composition prepared in Preparative Example 1 to the silica film, following baking at $400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

[0095] (B) Oxidant: (b1) Ceric ammonium nitrate (Samjeon Sunyak Inc.), (b2) Ferric nitrate (JUNSEI Inc.), (b3) Hydrogen peroxide (Dongwoo Finechem Inc.), (b4) Ammonium persulfate (Daejung Whakum Inc.)
[0096] (C) pH adjusting agent: Potassium hydroxide (Samjeon Sunyak Inc),
[0097] (D) Polishing accelerator: Formic acid (Daejung Whakum Inc.)
[0098] (2) Polishing Condition, Polishing Amount and Degree of Planarization
[0099] As a polishing pad, an H0800 CMP pad manufactured by FUJIÐO Inc. was used. Polishing was performed for 1 minute using a 200 mm MIRRA device manufactured by. Applied Materials, AMAT Inc., under the condition of a compressing pressure of 1.0 psi , a slurry flow rate of 200 $\mathrm{mL} /$ minute, a table and spindle rate of 90 rpm . Polishing amounts were measured and shown in Tables 1 and 2. The degree of planarization on the polished surface was determined by checking whether the CMP slurry composition uniformly polished the organic film, as compared with the inorganic film. After polishing as mentioned above, the thickness of the polished surface was measured using a thin film thickness measuring device (ST4000, K-MAC) (unit: $\AA$ ), and standard deviation was calculated from the result.

*Degree of planarization on polished surface (uniformity): A lower degree of planarization indicates better planarization.
[0100] As shown in Tables 1 and 2, it could be seen that the CMP slurry composition for organic films of the present invention had a high polishing rate and a high degree of planarization on the polished surface of the organic film having high carbon content, film density and hardness. Further, it could also be seen that, as compared with Example 1, Examples 2 to 18 had an enhanced polishing rate and an enhanced degree of planarization on the polished surface of the organic film having high carbon content, film density and hardness by further including a specific oxidant. [0101] Accordingly, the present invention provides a CMP slurry composition for organic films having excellent effects in polishing the organic film having high carbon content, film density and hardness. Further, the present invention provides a CMP slurry composition for organic films, which shows an excellent degree of planarization on the polished surface after polishing the organic film having high carbon
content, film density and hardness and allows easy removal of residues of the organic film remaining on the polishing stop film, thereby securing more uniform polishing.
[0102] Conversely, the compositions of Comparative Examples in which the metal oxide abrasive was included and was not acidic showed a significantly low polishing rate with respect to the organic film having high carbon content, film density and hardness, and a much lower degree of planarization on the polished surface than the composition of Examples.
