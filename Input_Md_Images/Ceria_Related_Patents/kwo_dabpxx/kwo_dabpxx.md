## METHOD FOR PREPARING SLURRY COMPOSITION AND SLURRY COMPOSITION PREPARED THEREBY

TECHNICAL FIELD

Example embodiments relate to a method of preparing a slurry composition and a slurry composition prepared by the method.

## BACKGROUND ART

With diversification and high integration of semiconductor devices, techniques for forming finer patterns are being used, and accordingly surface structures of semiconductor devices have become more complicated and step differences between surface films become greater. In manufacturing semiconductor devices, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is used as a planarization technique to remove a step of a particular film formed on a substrate. For example, CMP is a process for removing an insulating film excessively formed for interlayer insulation, which is widely used for planarization of an interlayer dielectric (ILD) and an insulating film for shallow trench isolation (STI) which insulates chips from each other and for formation of a metal conductive film, such as wiring, contact plug and via contact.

In CMP, a polishing speed, a planarization degree of a polished surface and an incidence of scratches are important. Such factors are determined depending on CMP conditions, slurry kinds and polishing pad types. In particular, a technique for removing large particles directly related to occurrence of scratches is more critical. When the average diameter of slurry is decreased to reduce scratches, polishing is reduced to decrease production. Thus, slurry having an appropriate size and distribution in view of polishing speed, dispersion stability and scratches is required for CMP. Further, when a small quantity of massive particles and agglomerated particles are present among particles although the particles are densely and uniformly distributed, reducing an occurrence of scratches is limited, and thus thoroughly removing the massive particles and agglomerated particles is preferable. Since even a small quantity of massive particles and agglomerated particles are included in the slurry, even a low number of scratches leads to decreased yields in CMP and subsequent STI. Accordingly a method of removing massive and agglomerated particles is required.

## BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION

Hereinafter, example embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. When it is determined detailed description related to a related known function or configuration they may make the purpose of the present invention unnecessarily ambiguous in describing the present invention, the detailed description will be omitted here. Also, terms used herein are defined to appropriately describe the example embodiments of the present invention and thus may be changed depending on a user, the intent of an operator, or a
custom. Accordingly, the terms must be defined based on the following overall description of this specification. Like reference numerals present in the drawings refer to the like elements throughout.

It will be understood throughout the whole specification that, unless specified otherwise, when one part "includes" or "comprises" one component, the part does not exclude other components but may further include the other components.

Hereinafter, a method of preparing a slurry composition 10 and a slurry composition prepared thereby will be described in detail with reference to embodiments and drawings. However, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments and drawings.

According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of preparing a slurry composition which includes preparing a raw material slurry composition by mixing cerium oxide abrasive particles, a dispersant and water, pulverizing the cerium oxide abrasive particles in the raw material slurry composition, removing massive particles and agglomerated particles from the raw material slurry composition by putting the raw material slurry composition containing the pulverized cerium oxide abrasive particles into a separation device including a horizontal cylindrical rotating body and subjecting the raw material slurry composition to centrifugation, and obtaining a massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed slurry composition.

The method of preparing the slurry composition according to the present invention may be conducted using the separation device including the horizontal cylindrical rotating body. In a slurry composition prepared using the separation device according to the present invention, massive particles and agglomerated particles are effectively removed without a decrease in a polished amount to reduce scratches in polishing and to decrease sizes of generated scratches, thereby minimizing defect rate by scratches.

The separation device is a slurry composition separation device which includes a horizontal cylindrical rotating body and a raw material slurry composition introduction unit formed on a central axis of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body, wherein the horizontal cylindrical rotating body includes an open end and a closed end, the open end is provided with a massive particles and agglomerated particles stopper having a step, a raw material slurry composition inlet of the raw material slurry composition introduction unit is formed around the closed end of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body.

The separation device is used for a classification process using centrifugation to remove massive particles and agglomerated particles which cause scratches in polishing, in which centrifugation is a process of classifying solid components according to magnitude of mass using a principle that concentrated solid components floating in a suspension migrate at different speeds depending on masses thereof when an external force, such as a gravitational force,
is applied to the solid components.

A generally used centrifuge including a vertical cylindrical rotating body allows a raw material slurry composition to vertically rise along a wall of the rotating body to overflow by high-speed rotations, making it difficult to obtain centrifugal effects by low-speed rotations. Thus, a high particle size decrease rate and a high solid removal rate are caused. However, the slurry composition separation device including the horizontal cylindrical rotating body according to the present invention may allow the raw material slurry composition to horizontally overflow even by centrifugal force by low-speed rotations, thereby obtaining sufficient centrifugal effects.

FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a slurry composition separation device according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 1, the slurry composition separation device $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ according to the embodiment of the present invention includes a horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ and a raw material slurry composition introduction unit $\mathbf{1 2 0}$, and may further include an external case $\mathbf{1 3 0}$. In addition, the slurry composition separation device $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ may further include the external case $\mathbf{1 3 0}$ including the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ and an outlet $\mathbf{1 4 0}$ on a bottom of the external case $\mathbf{1 3 0}$.

The horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ includes an open end $\mathbf{1 1 2}$ and a closed end $\mathbf{1 1 4}$, and the open end $\mathbf{1 1 2}$ includes massive particles and agglomerated particles stoppers 116 and 118 having a step.

The horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ may have a radius of 50 to 500 millimeters (mm). When the radius is shorter than 50 mm , sufficient centrifugal effects may not be obtained. When the radius is longer than 500 mm , an excessive amount of time is used for classification by centrifugation, thus deteriorating productivity.

The step of the massive particles and agglomerated particles stoppers 116 and 118 may be 10 to 200 mm . Massive particles and agglomerated particles in a raw material slurry composition containing abrasive particles may closely adhere to a rotation surface of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ to move from the closed end $\mathbf{1 1 4}$ of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ to the open end $\mathbf{1 1 2}$ of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ by centrifugal force during rotation of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$, and be trapped in the massive particles and agglomerated particles stoppers 116 and 118, thereby being removed from the raw material slurry composition.

The rotation surface of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body may include an uneven portion for the massive particles and agglomerated particles to effectively adhere. The uneven portion allows the massive particles and agglomerated particles to physically easily adhere to the rotation surface of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body.

The raw material slurry composition introduction unit $\mathbf{1 2 0}$ may be formed on a central axis of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ and include a raw material slurry composition inlet $\mathbf{1 2 2}$. The raw material slurry composition inlet 122 may be formed around the closed end $\mathbf{1 1 4}$ of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$, and accordingly the raw material slurry composition may be disposed on the central axis of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$.

A slurry composition obtained by removing the massive particles and agglomerated particles among the abrasive particles of the raw material slurry composition by rotation of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ moves to the open end $\mathbf{1 1 2}$ and is discharged over the massive particles and agglomerated particles stoppers 116 and 118.

The external case $\mathbf{1 3 0}$ is a horizontal cylindrical case sharing the central axis with the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$. The external case $\mathbf{1 3 0}$ of the slurry composition separation device according to the embodiment of the present invention may include a horizontal rectangular case in addition to the cylindrical case and be provided with any shape capable of including the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$, and is not limited to the preceding examples.

When the external case $\mathbf{1 3 0}$ is provided, the massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed slurry composition may be discharged via the outlet $\mathbf{1 4 0}$ at the bottom side of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$.

The slurry composition separation device $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ including the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ according to the present invention may obtain centrifugal effects even with low-speed rations as compared with a centrifugal separator including a vertical cylindrical rotating body and effectively remove the massive particles and agglomerated particles from the raw material slurry composition, thereby removing scratches and remaining particles on a wafer in polishing.

FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating a method of preparing a slurry composition according to an embodiment of the present invention.

Cerium oxide abrasive particles, a dispersant, a pH adjuster and water are mixed in the closed end $\mathbf{1 1 4}$ of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ through the raw material slurry composition introduction unit $\mathbf{1 2 0}$ of the slurry composition separation device $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ according to the embodiment of the present invention, thereby preparing a raw material slurry composition (S110).

The abrasive particles may include at least one of silica, zirconia, alumina, titania, barium titania, germania, mangania and magnesia in addition to the cerium oxide abrasive particles. The abrasive particles may be present at 0.1 to 10 wt $\%$ in the raw material slurry composition. When the abrasive particles are present at less than $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$, polishing speed may be reduced. When the abrasive particles are present at greater than $10 \mathrm{wt} \%$, defects by the abrasive particles may occur.

The dispersant serves to coat the metal oxide abrasive particles to improve dispersity of the metal oxide abrasive particles in the dispersing solution. The dispersant may include at least of ammonium salts, amine salts and aminoalcohol salts and be present at 0.1 to $10 \mathrm{wt} \%$ in the raw material slurry composition. When the dispersant is present at less than $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$, slurry is less adsorbed onto a polishing surface to decrease polishing rate. When the dispersant is present at greater than $10 \mathrm{wt} \%$, an excessive amount of dispersant may reduce dispersion stability to lead to agglomeration, thus causing microdefects and scratches.

The pH adjuster serves to adjust pH of the raw material slurry composition to control the dispersity of the abrasive particles. The pH adjuster may be any acid or base, and include at least one of ammonia, ammonium methyl propanol (AMP), tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, rubidium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium carbonate, triethanolamine, tromethamine, niacinamide, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, glutaric acid, gluconic acid, formic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, oxalic acid, phthalic acid, succinic acid and tartaric acid, without being limited thereto.

A content of the pH adjuster may be in a range of 0.01 to 1 wt $\%$ in the raw material slurry composition in which the adjuster does not hinder functions of the metal oxide abrasive particles, the dispersant and other components. When the pH adjuster is present at less than $0.01 \mathrm{wt} \%$, an electric repulsive force between the abrasive particles decreases to reduce storage stability to cause massive particles by agglomeration, thus resulting in defects including fine scratches after polishing. When the pH adjuster is present at greater than $1 \mathrm{wt} \%$, a surface of a wafer on which a nitride layer is deposited is negatively charged in a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process, such as a shallow trench isolation (STI) process, so that polishing speed may be reduced.

A remaining component of the raw material slurry composition for CMP according to the present invention, water, may preferably be ultrapure water.

The cerium oxide abrasive particles in the raw material slurry composition are pulverized (S120).

The foregoing pulverizing process is a process for pulverizing relatively weakly cohesive secondary metal oxide particles which are agglomerated to a desired diameter and evenly dispersing the metal oxide abrasive particles in the dispersing solution, which is essential for adjusting size, uniformity and dispersion stability degree of the particles. The pulverizing process may be performed using grinding with beads or ultrasonic milling, preferably jet milling. Jet milling is a method of allowing the abrasive particles in the abrasive particles dispersing solution to collide with each other to be destroyed, which causes less slurry contamination and applies an overall uniform impact, thereby pulverizing the particles to a uniform size and providing excellent productivity.

The pulverizing process may be performed using various types of jet milling equipment, such as a Nanomizer, Microfluidizer and Ultimizer.

The pulverizing process may be performed at a collision pressure of the mixture solution of 500 to 3,000 kilogram force/square centimeter $\left(\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}\right)$. Alternatively, the collision pressure may be 700 to $3000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ or 1000 to 3000 $\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. When the collision pressure is lower than 500 $\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$, it is difficult to pulverize the particles. When the collision pressure is greater than $3000 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$, the particles are pulverized into too small particles and economic efficiency is unfavorable.

The pulverizing process includes beads, in which dispersing and pulverizing processes are successively performed by impact energy, friction energy and shear stress by collisions between the beads and by collisions between the particles.

The raw material slurry composition containing the pulverized cerium oxide abrasive particles is disposed in the separation device including the horizontal cylindrical rotating body and is subjected to centrifugation, thereby removing massive particles and agglomerated particles from the raw material slurry composition (S130).

The raw material slurry composition may be put at 2 to 10 liters/minute ( $\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{min}$ ). When the raw material slurry composition is put at less than $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, efficiency is good but production time is long to deteriorate efficiency. When the raw material slurry composition is put at greater than 10 $\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{min}$, an excessive amount of the raw material slurry composition is subjected to centrifugal force for an insufficient period of time in the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ of the slurry composition separation device $\mathbf{1 0 0}$, so that the massive particles and agglomerated particles may not be easily removed.

Centrifuging the raw material slurry composition to remove the massive particles and agglomerated particles may be performed at a centrifugal force of, for example, 500 to $3,000 \mathrm{G}$ preferably 500 to $2,500 \mathrm{G}$ and more preferably 1,500 to $2,500 \mathrm{G}$.

The massive particles and agglomerated particles in the raw material slurry composition closely adhere to the rotation surface of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ rotating at 500 to $3,000 \mathrm{G}$ to horizontally move from the closed end $\mathbf{1 1 4}$ of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body 110 to the open end 112 of the horizontal cylindrical rotating body 110 , so that the massive particles and agglomerated particles, which are subjected to a great centrifugal force, are attached to an inner wall and trapped in the massive particles and agglomerated particles stoppers 116 and 118 to be
removed from the raw material slurry composition, whereas particles with small sizes horizontally pass through the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ over the massive particles and agglomerated particles stoppers 116 and 118, without being attached to the inner wall.

A centrifuge including a vertical cylindrical rotating body allows a raw material slurry composition to vertically rise along a wall of the rotating body to overflow by high-speed rotations, making it difficult to obtain centrifugal effects by low-speed rotations. Thus, a result is a high particle size decrease rate and a high solid removal rate. However, the slurry composition separation device $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ including the horizontal cylindrical rotating body $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ according to the present invention may allow the raw material slurry composition to horizontally overflow even by centrifugal force by low-speed rotations at 500 to 2500 G , thereby obtaining sufficient centrifugal effects.

A massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed 20 slurry composition is obtained (S140).

Secondary particle size of the abrasive particles may be measured using a laser scattering particle size distribution analyzer, such as Horiba LA-910. The secondary particle size of the abrasive particles in the raw material slurry composition may be 80 to 330 nm , and the secondary particle size of the abrasive particles in the massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed slurry composition may be 50 to 280 nm . A particle size refers to distribution of particles, which represents an average particle size. A decrease in secondary particle size after centrifugation is due to a decrease in average particle size since the massive particles and agglomerated particles are removed by centrifugation Thus, a decrease in minimum secondary particle size after centrifugation from 80 nm to 50 nm is due to a decrease in average particle size since the massive particles and agglomerated particles are absent in the massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed slurry composition.

A particle size ratio of the abrasive particles in the massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed slurry composition may be 0.3 to 1.0 according to Equation 1.
$\left(R_{2}-A_{2}\right) /\left(R_{1}-A_{1}\right)$
In Equation 1, $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ denotes D1 particle size before classification,
$\mathrm{B}_{1}$ denotes D99 particle size before classification,
$\mathrm{A}_{2}$ denotes D1 particle size after classification, and
$\mathrm{B}_{2}$ denotes D99 particle size after classification.
When the particle size ratio of the abrasive particles in the massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed slurry composition after centrifugation is less than 0.3 , residues, such as the massive particles and agglomerated particles, are insufficiently removed by centrifugation, and accordingly scratch incidence rate after polishing is increased. When the particles size ratio is greater than 1.0 , content of the abrasive particles after centrifugation is significantly reduced as compared with content of the abrasive particles before centrifugation, so that a yield is remarkably decreased.

A solid content in the raw material slurry composition may be 1 to $20 \mathrm{wt} \%$. When the solid content in the raw material slurry composition is greater than $20 \%$, which 65 means the massive particles and agglomerated particles are insufficiently removed, scratch incidence rate after polishing is increased.

A decrease rate of the solid content in the massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed slurry composition may be less than $30 \%$, preferably less than 20 by Equation 2.

$$
C_{2} / C_{1} \times 1 /(6)
$$

In Equation 2, $\mathrm{C}_{1}$ denotes solid content of the slurry composition before classification, and
$\mathrm{C}_{2}$ denotes solid content of the slurry composition after classification.

When the decrease rate of the solid content in the massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed slurry composition is $30 \%$ or greater, not only abnormal particles, such as the massive particles and agglomerated particles, but also normal particles are removed. Further, high ratios of massive particles and agglomerated particles are exhibited when compared to a slurry composition having a decrease rate of solid content of less than $30 \%$ when compared with a slurry composition having the same secondary particle size.

For example, a slurry composition having a solid removal rate of $30 \%$ or higher exhibits a particle size ratio of 0.3 or lower or 0.95 or higher after classification, and a slurry composition having a solid removal rate of less than $30 \%$ has a particle size ratio of 0.03 to 0.95 after classification. In this case, when the slurry compositions are compared in massive particle and scratch levels, the slurry composition having a solid removal rate of less than $30 \%$ has excellent improvement effects.

The method of preparing the slurry composition according to the present invention includes preparing a slurry composition in which numbers of massive particles and agglomerated particles among abrasive particles are adjusted according to sizes of the abrasive particles depending on solid content of the slurry composition. When the solid content of the slurry composition is decreased, the numbers of massive particles and agglomerated particles are decreased, in which degree of the decrease in the numbers of the massive particles and agglomerated particles caused by the decrease in the solid content of the slurry increases with particle sizes being greater by particle size. In particular, degree of the decrease in the number of the massive abrasive particles caused by the decrease in the solid content tends to drastically increase. That is, when the solid content is decreased to $1 / 2$ the degree of the decrease in the numbers of the massive particles and agglomerated particles is $1 / 2$ or greater. Also, this tendency becomes remarkable as the massive particles and agglomerated particles have a larger size, whereas a change in the number of the particles is relatively slight when the particles have a small size. Based on a solid content of $2.0 \mathrm{wt} \%$ in the massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed slurry composition, an accumulated number of abrasive particles with a diameter of 1.99 micrometers ( $\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) or greater may be $2.0 \mathrm{E} \times 10^{5} / \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{li}$ ters ( ml ) or less, an accumulated number of abrasive particles with a diameter of $1.00 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ or greater may be $3.0 \mathrm{E} \times$ $10^{5} / \mathrm{ml}$ or less, and an accumulated number of abrasive particles with a diameter of $0.70 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ or greater may be $3.0 \mathrm{E} \times 10^{9} / \mathrm{ml}$ or less.

In the present invention, not only the massive particles and agglomerated particles but fine particles are also removed by centrifugation, thereby reducing scratches and defects.

The method may further include subjecting the massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed slurry composition to a filter having 0.1 to $0.2 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ pores. The filter may include at least one selected from the group consisting of a membrane filter, a depth filter and a pleated filter.

According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided a slurry composition prepared by the preparing method according to the first aspect of the present invention.

Abrasive particles in a massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed slurry composition may have a secondary particle size of 50 to 280 nm .

Particle size ratio of the abrasive particles in the massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed slurry composition may be 0.3 to 1.0 according to Equation 1.

$$
\left(B_{2}-A_{2}\right) /\left(B_{1}-A_{1}\right)
$$

In Equation 1, $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ denotes D 1 particle size before classification,
$\mathrm{B}_{1}$ denotes D99 particle size before classification,
$\mathrm{A}_{2}$ is D 1 particle size after classification, and
$\mathrm{B}_{2}$ denotes D99 particle size after classification.
When the particle size ratio of the abrasive particles in the massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed slurry composition after centrifugation is less than 0.3 , residues, such as the massive particles and agglomerated particles, are insufficiently removed by centrifugation, and accordingly scratch incidence rate after polishing is increased. When the particles size ratio is greater than 1.0 , content of the abrasive particles after centrifugation is significantly reduced as compared with content of the abrasive particles before centrifugation, so that a yield is remarkably decreased.

A decrease rate of solid content in the massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed slurry composition may be less than $30 \%$, preferably less than $20 \%$ by Equation 2.

$$
C_{2} / C_{1} \times 1 /(6)
$$

In Equation 2, $\mathrm{C}_{1}$ denotes solid content of the slurry composition before classification, and
$\mathrm{C}_{2}$ is solid content of the slurry composition after classification.

When the decrease rate of the solid content in the massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed slurry composition is $20 \%$ or greater, not only abnormal particles, such as the massive particles and agglomerated particles, but also normal particles are removed. Further, high ratios of massive particles and agglomerated particles are exhibited when compared to a slurry composition having a decrease rate of solid content of less than $20 \%$ when compared with a slurry composition having the same secondary particle size.

Based on a solid content of $2.0 \mathrm{wt} \%$ in the massive particles and agglomerated particles-removed slurry composition, an accumulated number of abrasive particles with a diameter of $1.99 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ or greater may be $2.0 \mathrm{E} \times 10^{5} / \mathrm{ml}$ or less, an accumulated number of abrasive particles with a diameter of $1.00 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ or greater may be $3.0 \mathrm{E} \times 10^{5} / \mathrm{ml}$ or less, and an accumulated number of abrasive particles with a diameter of $0.70 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ or greater may be $3.0 \mathrm{E} \times 10^{8} / \mathrm{ml}$ or less.

The slurry composition of the present invention may reduce scratches and remaining particles, which are recognized as a major factor of decreasing a yield by massive particles and agglomerated particles, and maintaining a high polishing rate. Further, the slurry composition may be applied to various patterns required for a semiconductor process for ultra large scale integration and achieve excellent results in polishing rate, polishing selection ratio, within-wafer non-uniformity (WIWNU) representing polishing uniformity and minimization of microscratches for applications.
