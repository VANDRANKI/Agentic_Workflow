## CMP SLURRY COMPOSITION FOR POLISHING COPPER LINE AND POLISHING METHOD USING SAME

## TECHNICAL FIELD

[0001] The present invention relates to a CMP slurry composition for polishing copper interconnects and a polishing method using the same.

## BACKGROUND ART

[0002] In semiconductor fabrication, a CMP process refers to a process of planarizing a surface of a semiconductor wafer by applying a polishing agent-containing slurry thereto, followed by performing an orbital movement, in which rotational and linear movements are combined, under conditions that a polishing pad contacts the wafer surface.
[0003] Components of slurries used in the CMP process are mainly divided into polishing particles, which performs physical action, and a compound such as an etchant, which performs chemical action. Thus, a CMP slurry selectively etches an exposed portion of a wafer surface through physical action and chemical action, thereby allowing optimum and wide planarization to be accomplished.
[0004] Generally, in a semiconductor process, the CMP process is widely used as a process of forming metal interconnects and plugs or vias of a highly integrated circuit. In such a process, first, a low dielectric film, such as SOG, BPSG, O3-TEOS, USG, P-TEOS, FOX, or the like, is deposited on a wafer or a metal layer and a trench is formed in the low dielectric film through photolithography and dry etching. Next, in order to improve adhesion between the metal layer and the low dielectric film, a barrier layer is deposited using titanium, titanium nitride, tantalum, tantalum nitride, and the like. Next, a conductive material such as tungsten, aluminum, copper, or the like is deposited thereon by filling a pattern for metal interconnects or plugs therewith. Finally, the metal layer is completely removed from the low dielectric film by a CMP process using slurries for metal polishing, thereby forming metal interconnects, plugs, vias, and the like.
[0005] Since copper has various advantages in terms of efficiency in high integration and the like, copper is frequently used as a metallic material on a semiconductor wafer and forms a porous oxide layer composed of CuO , $\mathrm{CuO}_{2}, \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$ and the like, which are oxides of Cu and $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$, upon a CMP process. However, since copper is more vulnerable than a silicon material such as tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) or other materials such as tungsten despite a good polishing rate, copper is likely to suffer from scratching, and particularly, can cause a problem upon photolithography subsequent to a polishing process due to a phenomenon in which foreign substances such as components of a polishing slurry, oxide generated during the polishing process, and the like penetrate into a copper oxide layer through holes of the porous film.
[0006] In order to solve such problems, one or more complexing agents or chelating agents are generally added to a CMP slurry for polishing copper interconnects so as to allow chelation or complexation of $\mathrm{Cu}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}$ ions in a copper oxide layer such that the copper oxide layer can be reinforced through removal of holes due to porosity of the film, thereby preventing problems due to penetration of foreign substances during a CMP process. Examples of such
additives include imidazole compounds, such as triazole, benzotriazole and the like, and carboxyl group-containing compounds.
[0007] However, the polishing rate in the CMP process is deteriorated due to reinforcement of the copper oxide layer, and as a result, there occur problems such as erosion, dishing and the like due to over-polishing caused by increased polishing time. This cause an increase in fabrication costs due to deterioration in yield and productivity upon semiconductor fabrication.

[0025] The present invention relates to a CMP slurry composition for polishing copper interconnects, including ultrapure water, (A) colloidal silica, (B) an oxidant, (C) a complexing agent, (D) a corrosion inhibitor, and (E) a pH regulator.
[0026] Hereinafter, each of the components of the CMP slurry composition will be described in detail.
[0027] (A) Colloidal Silica
[0028] The CMP slurry composition according to the present invention may include the colloidal silica having a certain specific surface area.

In one embodiment, the colloidal silica may include at least one of first colloidal silica having a specific surface area of $81.2 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ to $83.2 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ and second colloidal silica having a specific surface area of $78.9 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ to $80.9 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$.
[0030] In one embodiment, the first and second colloidal silica may include at least one of spherical type colloidal silica and cocoon type colloidal silica. Preferably, the first colloidal silica is spherical type colloidal silica and the second colloidal silica is cocoon type colloidal silica. As such, when the first colloidal silica of the spherical type and the second colloidal silica of the cocoon type are mixed, the CMP slurry composition can significantly reduce scratching and have excellent properties in terms of polishing rate and dishing.
[0031] In one embodiment, the first colloidal silica and the second colloidal silica may be present in a weight ratio of 1:0.42 to 1:2.34. Within this range, the CMP slurry composition can reduce scratching and dishing while realizing relatively good polishing rate.
[0032] In one embodiment, the spherical type colloidal silica has an average particle diameter (D50) of 25 nm to 35 nm , preferably 30 nm to 35 nm . Within this range, the CMP slurry composition can realize relatively good polishing rate while effectively suppressing scratching and dishing. In one embodiment, the cocoon type colloidal silica may have a
major diameter of 50 nm to 55 nm and a minor diameter of 25 nm to 30 nm . Within this range, the CMP slurry composition can realize relatively good polishing rate while effectively suppressing scratching and dishing.

[0034] The colloidal silica may be present in an amount of $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $2 \mathrm{wt} \%$, preferably $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $1 \mathrm{wt} \%$, in the CMP slurry composition. If the amount of the colloidal silica is out of this range, the CMP slurry composition can suffer from reduction in polishing rate and deterioration in storage stability.

Examples of the compounds including an element in the highest oxidation state may include periodic acid and salts thereof, perbromic acid and salts thereof, perchloric acid and salts thereof, perboric acid and salts thereof, and permanganic acid and salts thereof, without being limited thereto. Preferably, the oxidant includes hydrogen peroxide, peroxydisulfuric acid and salts thereof, and iodic acid and salts thereof.

[0039] The oxidant may be mixed with a CMP slurry precursor composition including no oxidant immediately before polishing.
[0040] (C) Complexing Agent
[0041] Optionally, the slurry composition may further include a chelating agent or a complexing agent. The complexing agent may be any chemical additive improving a removal rate of a substrate layer.

[0046] (D) Corrosion Inhibitor
[0047] The corrosion inhibitor is a material retarding chemical reaction of an oxidant and serves as a polishing regulator enabling polishing by suppressing corrosion of a low step height area, in which physical polishing does not occur, and while allowing a high step height area, in which polishing occurs, to be removed due to physical action of a polishing agent. A nitrogen-containing compound is mainly used as the corrosion inhibitor, and may include, for example, ammonia, alkylamines, amino acids, imines, azoles, and the like. These corrosion inhibitors may be used alone or in combination thereof. Preferably, the corrosion inhibitor includes compounds including cyclic nitrogen compounds and derivatives thereof, more preferably compounds including benzotriazole and derivatives thereof, still more preferably at least one selected from the group consisting of benzotriazole, methylbenzotriazole, 1,2,3-triazole, triazole derivatives, benzotriazole derivatives, and methylbenzotriazole derivatives.

[0049] (E) pH Regulator
[0050] Optionally, the slurry composition may further include one or more components, such as a pH regulator, an adjusting agent and a buffering agent, which consist in

A suitable pH regulator, adjusting agent, or buffering agent includes, for example, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, potassium phosphate, and mixtures thereof.
[0051] In one embodiment, the CMP slurry composition according to the present invention may have a pH of 6 to 8 . Within this range, the CMP slurry composition can prevent corrosion of metal.
[0052] The pH regulator may be present in an amount of $0.001 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $5 \mathrm{wt} \%$ in the CMP slurry composition.
