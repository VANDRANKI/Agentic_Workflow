## ABSTRACT

The present disclosure relates to a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) slurry composition that provides for a high metal to dielectric material selectivity along with a low rate of metal recess formation. In some embodiments, the disclosed slurry composition has an oxidant and an etching inhibitor. The oxidant has a compound with one or more oxygen molecules. The etching inhibitor has a nitrogen-oxide compound. The etching inhibitor reduces the rate of metal and dielectric material (e.g., oxide) removal, but does so in a manner that reduces the rate of dielectric material removal by a larger amount, so as to provide the slurry composition with a high metal (e.g., germanium) to dielectric material removal selectivity and with a low rate of metal recess formation.

## 1 <br> CHEMICAL MECHANICAL POLISHING METHOD USING SLURRY COMPOSITION CONTAINING N-OXIDE COMPOUND

## BACKGROUND

Integrated chips are constructed using complex fabrication processes that form a plurality of different layers on top of one another. Many of the different layers are patterned using photolithography, a process by which a photoresist material is selectively exposed to electromagnetic radiation. For example, photolithography may be used to define back-end-of-the-line metallization layers that are formed on top of one another. To ensure that the metallization layers are formed with a good structural definition, the electromagnetic radiation must be properly focused. To properly focus electromagnetic radiation, a workpiece must be substantially planar to avoid depth of focus problems.

Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is a widely used process by which both chemical and mechanical forces are used to globally planarize a semiconductor workpiece. The planarization prepares the workpiece for the formation of a subsequent layer. A typical CMP system comprises a rotating platen covered by a polishing pad. A slurry distribution system is configured to provide a chemical mechanical polishing slurry to the polishing pad. A workpiece is then brought into contact with the pad, causing the rotating platen to planarize the workpiece.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

The description herein is made with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are generally utilized to refer to like elements throughout, and wherein the various structures are not necessarily drawn to scale. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific
details are set forth in order to facilitate understanding. It will be appreciated that the details of the figures are not intended to limit the disclosure, but rather are non-limiting embodiments. For example, it may be evident, however, to one of ordinary skill in the art, that one or more aspects described herein may be practiced with a lesser degree of these specific details. In other instances, known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form to facilitate understanding.

Germanium has been widely studied as a means to improve the performance of integrated chips because it offers a high electron mobility. One application of germanium in modern integrated chip design is in fin field effect transistor (finFET). To develop a silicon-germanium (SiGe) finFET, a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process may be used to remove excess germanium from a surface of a substrate.

Typical CMP processes performed during the formation of a SiGe finFET may use a slurry comprising hydrogen peroxide. Such a slurry can give a high germanium to oxide removal selectivity that acts to remove excess germanium without removing oxide. However, such a slurry also forms recesses within the germanium channel regions of the finFET device. Such recesses make the resulting thickness of the germanium channel regions, causing poor device performance. Therefore, a CMP process that uses a slurry having a high germanium to oxide removal selectivity and a low rate of germanium recess formation is desirable to achieve good device performance.

Accordingly, the present disclosure relates to a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) slurry composition that provides for a high metal to dielectric material selectivity along with a low rate of metal recess formation. In some embodiments, the disclosed slurry composition comprises an oxidant and an etching inhibitor. The oxidant comprises a compound having one or more oxygen molecules. The etching inhibitor comprises a nitrogen-oxide compound. The etching inhibitor reduces the rate of metal and dielectric material removal, but does so in a manner that reduces the rate of dielectric material (e.g., oxide) removal by a larger amount, so as to provide the slurry composition with a high metal (e.g., germanium) to dielectric material (e.g., oxide) removal selectivity and with a low rate of metal recess formation.

FIG. 1 illustrates a side view of some embodiments of a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) tool 100 having a slurry distribution element $\mathbf{1 2 0}$ configured to distribute a slurry $\mathbf{1 2 2}$ that achieves a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process with a high metal to dielectric material removal selectivity (i.e., a ratio of an amount of metal removed to an amount of dielectric material removed) and a low rate of metal recess formation.

The CMP tool $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ comprises a polishing pad $\mathbf{1 0 2}$ configured to perform polishing of a semiconductor substrate 112. The polishing pad $\mathbf{1 0 2}$ is located on a platen $\mathbf{1 0 4}$, which rotates the polishing pad $\mathbf{1 0 2}$ about an axis of rotation $\mathbf{1 0 6}$ during operation of the CMP tool 100. A pad conditioning element $\mathbf{1 0 8}$, comprising a diamond grit conditioning pad, is configured to push on the polishing pad $\mathbf{1 0 2}$ with a downward force that brings the plurality of diamond particles into contact with the polishing pad $\mathbf{1 0 2}$. As the polishing pad $\mathbf{1 0 2}$ is rotated by the platen $\mathbf{1 0 4}$, the diamond particles roughen the surface of the polishing pad $\mathbf{1 0 2}$ to provide for improved mechanical polishing.

The CMP tool $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ further comprises a workpiece carrier 110. The workpiece carrier $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ is configured to house the semiconductor substrate $\mathbf{1 1 2}$ in an upside down position so that a top surface of the semiconductor substrate $\mathbf{1 1 2}$ faces the rotating polishing pad 102. The workpiece carrier $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ is operable to bring the semiconductor substrate $\mathbf{1 1 2}$ into con-

tact with the rotating polishing pad 102. By bringing the semiconductor substrate 112 into contact with the rotating polishing pad 102, polishing of the semiconductor substrate 112 is performed.

The semiconductor substrate 112 comprises a semiconductor body 114 as well as an overlying dielectric material layer 116 (e.g., oxide) and an overlying metal layer 118. In some embodiments, the semiconductor body 114 may comprise silicon, germanium, a III-V semiconductor material (i.e., comprising a combination of one or more group III elements with one or more group V elements), or some other semiconductor material. The dielectric material layer 116 and the metal layer 118 share a common interface that faces the rotating polishing pad 102. In some embodiments, the metal layer 118 may comprise germanium, while in other embodiments, the metal layer 118 may comprise other metals (e.g., copper, aluminum, etc.). In some embodiments, the dielectric material layer 116 may comprise silicon dioxide, while in other embodiments, the dielectric material layer 116 may comprise other dielectric materials (e.g., SiCO).

A slurry distribution element 120 is configured to deposit a chemical mechanical polishing slurry 122 onto the polishing pad 102. The chemical mechanical polishing slurry 122 comprises an oxidant and an etching inhibitor. The oxidant comprises a compound having one or more oxygen molecules (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, potassium peroxydisulfate, etc.). The etching inhibitor comprises a nitrogen-oxide compound. The nitrogen oxide compound may have a chemical formula of R1R2R3N* $-\mathrm{O}^{-}$, wherein R1 is a first substituent, R2 is a second substituent, and R3 is a third substituent. The nitro-gen-oxide compound reduces the rate of metal and dielectric material (e.g., oxide) removal, but does so in a manner that reduces the rate of dielectric material removal by a larger amount, so that the slurry 122 provides for a CMP process having a high metal (e.g., germanium) to dielectric material removal selectivity and with a low rate of metal recess formation. In other words, the slurry 122 provides for a CMP process that removes a greater thickness of the metal layer 118 than the dielectric material layer 116, while causing a low recess in the metal layer 118. In some embodiments, the disclosed slurry 122 may provide for a removal of the metal layer 118 and the dielectric material layer 116 having a selectivity that is greater than or equal to 30 (i.e., removed metal thickness/removed dielectric material thickness $>30$ ).

It will be appreciated that in some embodiments the disclosed slurry 122 may comprise additional components. For example, the slurry 122 may comprise a surfactant (e.g., polyethylene glycol) configured to lower the surface tension of the slurry 122. In other embodiments, the slurry may comprise abrasive particles that are used in mechanical polishing of the semiconductor substrate. For example, the slurry 122 may comprise abrasive particles comprising colloidal silica, fumed silica, aluminum oxide, silica shell based composite submicron particles. In other embodiments, the slurry 122 may be abrasive free (i.e., the slurry 122 does not comprise abrasive particles).

FIG. 2 illustrates some embodiments of a chemical structure 200 of a disclosed slurry with an etching inhibitor 202 comprising a nitrogen-oxide compound.

As illustrated by chemical structure 200, the slurry comprises an etching inhibitor 202 and an oxidant 204. The oxidant 204 comprises one or more oxygen molecules. In various embodiments, the oxidant 204 may comprise hydrogen peroxide, potassium peroxydisulfate, ammonium peroxydisulfate, sodium peroxydisulfate, potassium peroxymonosulfate, peracetic acid, or tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide, for example.

The etching inhibitor 202 comprises a nitrogen-oxide compound having the chemical formula of R1R2R3N* $-\mathrm{O}^{-}$, wherein R1 is a first substituent, R2 is a second substituent, and R3 is a third substituent. In some embodiments, the nitrogen-oxide compound comprises a nitrogen $(\mathrm{N})$ molecule bonded to an oxygen (O) molecule. In some embodiments, the etching inhibitor 202 may comprise first and second substituents, R1 and R2, comprising a chain of between approximately 1 and 20 carbon alkyl substituents and a third substituent R3 comprising a chain of between approximately 1 and 10 carbon alkyl substituents. In some embodiments, the alkyl substituent may be disposed within parent chains, while in other embodiments the alkyl substituent may be disposed within side chains, which are carbon chains that are not in the parent chain, but are branched off from it. In yet other embodiments, the alkyl substituent may comprise cyclic substituents.

In some embodiments, the etching inhibitor 202 may comprise pyridine N-oxide, 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-1oxyl (TEMPO), 4-methylpyridine N-oxide, N-methylmorpholine N-oxide, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide, trimethylamine N-oxide; quinoline N-oxide, or 2-mercaptopyridine N-oxide, for example.

The slurry may comprise a concentration of the oxidant 204 that is in a range of between approximately 10 ppm (parts per million) and 50,000 ppm and a concentration of the etching inhibitor 202 that is in a range of between approximately 1 ppm (parts per million) and 10,000 ppm. The slurry may further comprise a pH level having a range of between approximately 1 and approximately 10 . For example, in one embodiment a slurry composition may comprise $1,000 \mathrm{ppm}$ colloidal silica, $8,000 \mathrm{ppm}$ hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right), 300$ ppm 2-mercaptopyridine N-oxide, and have a pH level of 6 . In such an embodiment, the 2-mercaptopyridine will be formed as a passive film onto a metal (e.g., germanium) surface. The slurry composition then operates to enable a chemical mechanical polishing that provides for a germanium removal rate of approximately 365 angstroms $/ \mathrm{min}$.

FIG. 3 illustrates a flow chart of some embodiments of a method 300 of performing a chemical mechanical polishing process with a high metal to oxide removal selectivity and a low rate of metal recess formation.

While the disclosed methods (e.g., methods 300 and 600) are illustrated and described below as a series of acts or events, it will be appreciated that the illustrated ordering of such acts or events are not to be interpreted in a limiting sense. For example, some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts or events apart from those illus-
50 trated and/or described herein. In addition, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement one or more aspects or embodiments of the description herein. Further, one or more of the acts depicted herein may be carried out in one or more separate acts and/or phases.

At 302, a semiconductor substrate is provided onto a platen of a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) tool. The semiconductor substrate comprises a metal region and an oxide region sharing a common interface. For example, the metal region and the oxide region may comprise adjacent regions on a top surface of a semiconductor substrate. In some embodiments, the metal region may comprise germanium.

At 304, the platen is rotated around an axis of rotation. Rotation of the platen causes the semiconductor substrate to rotate around the axis of rotation.

At 306, a slurry comprising an oxidant and an etching inhibitor having a nitrogen-oxide ( N -oxide) compound is provided onto the common interface.

At 308, a chemical mechanical polishing pad is brought into contact with the rotating semiconductor substrate. Upon being brought into contact with the polishing pad, the semiconductor substrate is polishing, thereby removing excess metal from semiconductor substrate. Since the slurry, which comprises an etching inhibitor, is used in the polishing process the chemical mechanical polishing process is performed with a high metal to oxide removal selectivity and a low rate of metal recess formation

FIG. 4 illustrates some additional embodiments of a disclosed chemical mechanical polishing slurry manufacturing and delivery system 400.

The chemical mechanical polishing slurry manufacturing and delivery system 400 comprises a slurry manufacturing tank 402 configured to manufacture slurry, which is then packaged into a slurry container 408. The slurry manufacturing tank 402 is connected to an oxidant source 404 and to an etching inhibitor source 406. The oxidant source 404 is configured to provide an oxidant to the slurry manufacturing tank 402. In various embodiments, the oxidant may comprise hydrogen peroxide, potassium peroxydisulfate, ammonium peroxydisulfate, sodium peroxydisulfate, potassium peroxymonosulfate, peracetic acid, or tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide.

The etching inhibitor source 406 is configured to provide an etching inhibitor to the slurry manufacturing tank 402, comprising a nitrogen-oxide compound having a chemical formula of R1R2R3N ${ }^{-}-\mathrm{O}^{-}$, wherein R1 is a first substituent, R 2 is a second substituent, and R 3 is a third substituent. In various embodiments, the substituents, R1-R3, may comprise different chemicals or the same chemicals. For example, the substituents, R1-R3, may comprise chains of carbon alkyl substituent, as described above. In some embodiments, the slurry manufacturing tank 402 may comprise additional inlets configured to provide de-ionized water and/or abrasives to the slurry manufacturing tank 402, which are subsequently introduced into the slurry.

The slurry packaged within the slurry container 408 is configured to be transported into a day tank 410 comprised within a slurry delivery system. In the slurry delivery system, the slurry is provided by way of a transport piping 412 from the day tank 402 to one or more valve manifold boxes 414. The valve manifold boxes 414 are configured to selectively provide the slurry from the transport piping 412 to a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) tool 416, when the CMP tool 416 is operated to perform a chemical mechanical polishing of a semiconductor substrate.

In some embodiments, a re-circulation transport piping 418 is configured to return slurry that has not been provided to the CMP tool 416 from the one or more valve manifold boxes 414 to the slurry day tank 410 . The slurry day tank 410 is configured to mix the unused slurry with new slurry to maintain a slurry having a high metal to oxide selectivity with a low rate of metal recess formation. The nitrogen-oxide compound further increases the life of the slurry within the slurry day tank 410. For example, in some embodiments, the slurry may be reused for at time period of at least six months.

FIGS. 7A-7F illustrate cross-sectional views of some embodiments of an exemplary semiconductor substrate, whereon a method of forming a SiGe FinFET according to method 600 is implemented. Although FIGS. 7A-7F are described in relation to method 600, it will be appreciated that the structures disclosed in FIGS. 7A-7F are not limited to such a method. Rather, it will be appreciated that the illustrated structures of FIGS. 7A-7F provide for a structural description of a SiGe FinFET that is able to stand alone independent of a method.

FIG. 7A illustrates some embodiments of a cross-sectional view $\mathbf{7 0 0}$ corresponding to $\mathbf{6 0 2 - 6 0 4}$. As shown in cross-sectional view $\mathbf{7 0 0}$, a semiconductor substrate $\mathbf{7 0 2}$ is selectively etched to form a first plurality of trenches. The first plurality of trenches extend from a top surface of the semiconductor substrate $\mathbf{7 0 2}$ to a position within the semiconductor substrate $\mathbf{7 0 2}$ and leave a plurality of silicon pillars extending out from the semiconductor substrate 702. An oxide $\mathbf{7 0 4}$ or other dielectric material is then formed within the plurality of trenches. In some embodiments, the oxide $\mathbf{7 0 4}$ may comprise silicon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\right)$.

FIG. 7B illustrates some embodiments of a cross-sectional view $\mathbf{7 0 6}$ corresponding to $\mathbf{6 0 6}$. As shown in cross-sectional view $\mathbf{7 0 6}$, the semiconductor substrate $\mathbf{7 0 2}$ is selectively etched to remove silicon to form a second plurality of trenches $\mathbf{7 0 8}$.

FIG. 7C illustrates some embodiments of a cross-sectional view $\mathbf{7 1 0}$ corresponding to $\mathbf{6 0 8}$. As shown in cross-sectional view $\mathbf{7 1 0}$, germanium and/or a III-V semiconductor material $\mathbf{7 1 2}$ is deposited in the second plurality of trenches $\mathbf{7 0 8}$ to form a plurality of channel regions.

FIG. 7D illustrates some embodiments of a cross-sectional view $\mathbf{7 1 4}$ corresponding to $\mathbf{6 1 0}$. As shown in cross-sectional view 710, a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process is performed using a CMP slurry having a etching inhibitor that provides for a high germanium oxide selectivity with a low rate of recess formation in the germanium. The chemical mechanical polishing process removes excess material from the substrate. In some embodiments, the chemical mechanical polishing process forms a planar substrate along CMP line 716. Since the slurry provides for a high germanium oxide selectivity, germanium and/or the III-V semiconductor material $\mathbf{7 1 2}$ is removed from the semiconductor substrate at a higher rate than the oxide $\mathbf{7 0 4}$, resulting in a substantially flat surface on the top of the semiconductor substrate.

FIG. 7E illustrates some embodiments of a cross-sectional view $\mathbf{7 1 8}$ corresponding to $\mathbf{6 1 2}$. As shown in cross-sectional view $\mathbf{7 1 8}$, three-dimensional fins $\mathbf{7 2 0}$ are formed by selectively etching back the oxide $\mathbf{7 0 4}$. The three-dimensional fins comprise germanium and/or the III-V semiconductor material.

FIG. 7F illustrates some embodiments of a three-dimensional view $\mathbf{7 2 2}$ corresponding to $\mathbf{6 1 4 - 6 1 6}$. As shown in threedimensional view $\mathbf{7 2 2}$, a gate region $\mathbf{7 2 4}$ is formed at a position overlying the three-dimensional fins $\mathbf{7 2 0}$. Source and drain regions $\mathbf{7 2 6}$ are formed within the three-dimensional fins $\mathbf{7 2 0}$ at opposite sides of the gate region $\mathbf{7 2 4}$. In some embodiments, the source and drain regions $\mathbf{7 2 6}$ may be formed by selectively etching the three-dimensional fins $\mathbf{7 2 0}$ to form source and drain recesses, and subsequently performing an epitaxial growth to form the source and drain regions $\mathbf{7 2 4}$ within the recesses. Although, FIG. 7F illustrates a Fin-

FET device having two gates, it will be appreciated that in alternative embodiments, a disclosed finFET may be formed to have any number of gates.

FIG. 8 is a chart $\mathbf{8 0 0}$ showing the germanium to oxide 5 selectivity of some embodiments of a disclosed slurry with an etching inhibitor. The first row of the chart $\mathbf{8 0 0}$ describes a first slurry composition that does not contain a nitrogen oxide etching inhibitor, such that comparison of rows 2-5 to the first row indicates the effect of the nitrogen-oxide etching inhibitor.

The first row of the chart $\mathbf{8 0 0}$ illustrates a first slurry composition without a nitrogen-oxide etching inhibitor.

The second slurry composition provides for a rate of germanium removal of approximately 1845 angstroms/minute, and for a rate of oxide removal of approximately 28 angstroms/minute. Therefore, the resulting germanium to oxide selectivity is 65 and a germanium recess is formed having a depth of 100 angstroms.

The third row of the chart $\mathbf{8 0 0}$ illustrates a third slurry composition comprising a nitrogen-oxide etching inhibitor. The third slurry composition comprises 2,000 ppm colloidal silica, 30,000 ppm ammonium peroxydisulfate, 5,000 ppm 4-methylpyridine N -oxide, 500 ppm polyethylene glycol, and has a pH level of 3 . The third slurry composition provides for a rate of germanium removal of approximately 1,245 angstroms/minute, and for a rate of oxide removal of approximately 15 angstroms/minute. Therefore, the resulting germanium to oxide selectivity is 83 and a germanium recess is formed having a depth of 35 angstroms.

The fourth slurry composition comprises 2,000 ppm colloidal silica, 8,000 ppm tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide, 3,000 ppm N -methylmorpholine N -oxide, 500 ppm polyethylene glycol, and has a pH level of 6 . The fourth slurry composition provides for a rate of germanium removal of approximately 1,856 angstroms/minute, and for a rate of oxide removal of approximately 21 angstroms/minute. Therefore, the resulting germanium to oxide selectivity is 88 and a germanium recess is formed having a depth of 48 angstroms.

The fifth row of the chart $\mathbf{8 0 0}$ illustrates a fifth slurry composition comprising a nitrogen-oxide etching inhibitor. The fifth slurry composition comprises 8,000 ppm tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide, 3,000 ppm N-methylmorpholine N-oxide, 500 ppm polyethylene glycol, and has a pH level of 10 . The fifth slurry composition is free of abrasive particles. The fifth slurry composition provides for a rate of germanium removal of approximately 656 angstroms/minute, and for a rate of oxide removal of approximately 3 angstroms/minute. Therefore, the resulting germanium to oxide selectivity is 218 and a germanium recess is formed having a depth of 25 angstroms.
