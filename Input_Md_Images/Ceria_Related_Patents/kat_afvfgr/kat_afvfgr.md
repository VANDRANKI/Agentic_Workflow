## 1 <br> CERIUM OXIDE POWDER AND CERIUM OXIDE DISPERSION

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The invention relates to a powder based on cerium oxide, a process for preparing the powder, and uses of the powder. The invention further relates to a dispersion containing the powder.
2. Description of the Related Art

Cerium oxide is a significant constituent of catalysts. Furthermore, cerium oxide is an important material for the polishing of glass and electronic components. Particularly in the field of chemomechanical polishing, the journal and patent literature describes numerous ways for improving the properties of cerium oxide powders and of cerium oxide dispersions.

Cerium oxide is usually prepared by calcination of cerium hydroxides or cerium carbonates. The calcined oxides are then milled and sieved to form powders.

Wet-chemical routes and gas-phase processes for preparing cerium oxide are also known. Cerium oxide can be prepared by hydrothermal synthesis, as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,389,352. Here, cerium(III) salts are converted oxidatively at elevated temperature and pressure into cerium oxide which crystallizes out in the form of fine particles.

Gas-phase processes such as spray pyrolysis methods in which a cerium oxide precursor, usually in the form of an aerosol, is oxidized in a flame are of particular interest. One such method is described in U.S. published application 2001036437.

In J. Mater. Res., Vol. 17, pages 1356-1362 (2002), Pratsinis et al. describe the preparation of cerium oxide powders of high crystallinity by flame spray pyrolysis of cerium acetate solutions in solvent mixtures comprising acetic acid, isooctane and 2-butanol by oxidation by means of oxygen in an oxygen/methane flame. The solvent mixture is essential to the preparation of a cerium oxide powder which is free of relatively coarse particles.
U.S. published application 2004126298 describes a process for preparing metal oxides, in which droplets are produced from a solution and these are oxidized in a flame. The solution contains at least one starting material and at least $60 \%$, based on the total solution, of a carboxylic acid as solvent.

A process for preparing cerium oxide comprising coarse and fine material is known from U.S. Pat. No. 6,887,566. This process discloses the combustion of an aerosol of a cerium oxide precursor in a high-temperature zone of $700-1,100 \mathrm{~K}$.
DE-A-10251029 discloses a pyrogenic cerium oxide powder having a coarse fraction comprising crystalline, nonaggregated particles having a mean diameter of from 30 to 200 nm and a fine fraction in the form of aggregates of finely crystalline, grown-together primary particles having a mean aggregate diameter of from 5 to 50 nm and a BET surface area of from 15 to $200 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$.
U.S. published application 2005036928 discloses a polycrystalline cerium oxide powder in the form of aggregates of primary particles having a specific surface area of from 70 to $150 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$, a mean primary particle diameter of from 5 to 20 nm and a mean, projected aggregate diameter of from 20 to 100 nm and a dispersion containing this cerium oxide powder. Furthermore, numerous dispersions containing cerium oxide for chemomechanical polishing are described.
U.S. Pat. No. 6,663,683 discloses an aqueous dispersion containing pyrogenic silicon dioxide doped with cerium oxide, with the cerium oxide being introduced via an aerosol of a cerium salt solution or suspension and the mean particle size in the dispersion being less than 100 nm .
U.S. Pat. No. 6,767,377 discloses an aqueous dispersion which contains particles having a core of doped, pyrogenic low-structured silicon dioxide and a cerium oxide shell and does not exceed a mean secondary particle size of $0.2 \mu \mathrm{~m}$.
U.S. published application 2005074610 discloses a dispersion of pyrogenic cerium oxide which does not have any particles larger than $1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$.
U.S. Pat. No. 6,827,752 describes a cerium oxide dispersion which is stabilized by polyacrylates.
U.S. Pat. No. 6,443,811 describes a cerium oxide dispersion in a neutral to weakly basic medium which contains a cationic surface-active agent.
U.S. Pat. No. 6,420,269 describes a cerium oxide dispersion which has a pH in the range from 8 to 12 and contains a dispersant, preferably a water-soluble organic polymer, a water-soluble anionic or nonionic surface-active agent or a water-soluble amine.

A disadvantage of the cerium oxide dispersions according to the prior art is that satisfactory stability in the neutral to weakly alkaline range can be achieved only in the presence of additives.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a dispersion which is based on cerium oxide and is, without additional additives, sufficiently stable in the neutral to weakly alkaline range to be able to be used for chemomechanical polishing.

A further object of the invention is to provide a powder based on cerium oxide.

A further object is to provide a process for preparing a powder based on cerium oxide.

A further object of the invention is to provide a method of polishing a substrate with a dispersion of a powder based on cerium oxide.

## BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

A more complete appreciation of the invention and many of the attendant advantages thereof will be readily obtained as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings, wherein:

FIG. 1 shows the removal rate of polishing as a function of contact pressure and velocity;

FIG. 2 shows the motor current of a polishing process as a function of time for $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Si}_{3} \mathrm{~N}_{4}$.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

In one aspect, the invention provides a cerium oxide powder which, in one embodiment, has carbonate groups and comprises crystalline primary particles which contain cerium oxide and have carbonate groups on the surface of the crystalline primary particles and in a region close to the surface of the crystalline primary particles, wherein the powder has a BET surface area of from 25 to $150 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$;
the primary particles have a mean diameter of from 5 to 50 nm ;

the region close to the surface of the primary particles is at a depth of about 5 nm from the surface of the primary particles;
the carbonate concentration in the region close to the surface decreases inwards from the surface on which the carbonate concentration is highest;
the carbon content due to the carbonate groups on the surface is from 5 to $50 \%$ by area and that at a depth of about 5 nm in the region close to the surface is from 0 to $30 \%$ by area;
the content of cerium oxide, calculated as $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and based on the powder, is at least $99.5 \%$ by weight; and
the content of carbon, encompassing organic and inorganic carbon, is from 0.01 to $0.3 \%$ by weight, based on the total weight of the cerium oxide powder.

The carbonate groups in the powder of the invention can be detected both on the surface and also in a region at a depth of up to about 5 nm from the surface of the primary particles. The carbonate groups are chemically bound, e.g., chemically bound to cerium and/or cerium oxide, and can, for example, be present in the structures a-c.
![img-2.jpeg](images\img-2.jpeg)

The carbonate groups can, for example, be detected by XPS/ESCA analysis. To detect the carbonate groups in the region close to the surface, a part of the surface can be removed by means of argon ion bombardment to expose the region close to the surface and thereby form a new surface. The resulting new surface can likewise be analysed by means of XPS/ESCA (XPS-X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; ESCA=electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis). Using this method the carbonate concentration at different depths from the surface of the particle can be calculated on a $\%$ by area basis.

In embodiments, the primary particles of the powder of the invention can be present in isolated form, be more or less strongly aggregated, or be a combination of isolated and aggregated. The primary particles are preferably very largely in aggregated form. Preferably at least $50 \%$ of the primary particles are in an aggregated form, more preferably at least $70 \%$, even more preferably at least $80 \%$, more preferably at least $90 \%$, most preferably at least $95 \%$ of the primary particles are in aggregated form.

The powder of the invention can preferably have a proportion of sodium of $<5 \mathrm{ppm}$ and of chlorine of $<20 \mathrm{ppm}$. The elements mentioned can generally be tolerated only in small amounts in chemomechanical polishing. More preferably, the powder of the invention has less than 4 ppm , more preferably less than 3 ppm , more preferably less than 2 ppm and most
preferably less than 1 ppm of sodium based on the total weight of the powder. Preferably the powder of the invention has less than 10 ppm of chlorine, more preferably less than 5 ppm chlorine, even more preferably less than 2 ppm of chlorine based on the total weight of the powder.

Furthermore, a BET surface area of from 30 to $100 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ is preferred for the powder of the invention. A BET surface area of $40-80 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ is particularly preferred for polishing applications.

The invention further provides a process for preparing a cerium oxide-based powder having carbonate groups, in which
an aerosol is reacted with an oxygen-containing gas at a reaction temperature of from $600^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. to $1500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$., preferably from $900^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. to $1200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$., more preferably from $1050^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. to $1150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$., in a reaction chamber, the reaction mixture is cooled and the powder is subsequently separated off from the gaseous substances by means of a filter, with
the aerosol being obtained by atomization of at least one solution containing an organic solvent or solvent mixture and an oxidizable, organic cerium(III) compound dissolved therein by means of at least one atomization gas and
the volume-based, mean droplet diameter $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{xo}}$ of the aerosol being from 30 to $100 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ and the mean residence time in the reaction chamber being from 0.1 s to 5 s , wherein
the reaction mixture is cooled after leaving the reaction chamber by spraying water droplets into it,
the water droplets have a mean, volume-based droplet diameter of less than $100 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ and
to generate the water droplets, water is added in an amount according to equation I

$$
m_{H O O}=\int \mathrm{cp}_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}{ }^{*}\left(T_{0}-T_{0}\right)+d h_{v}+\mathrm{cp}_{\mathrm{g}}{ }^{*}\left(T_{e}-T_{e}\right)\right] / 3600 * Q
$$

where
Q-total combustion enthalpy of all starting materials in KW
$\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{H} O O}=$ amount of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in $\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{h}$ required to achieve the end temperature $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}$
$\mathrm{T}_{0}=$ inlet temperature of water
$\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}=$ boiling point of water at 1 bar

$\mathrm{cp}_{\mathrm{g}}=$ heat capacity of water vapour at $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
and
$\mathrm{T}_{0}=5-50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}=100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{e}}=200-400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{dh}_{\mathrm{v}}=2256.7$ $\mathrm{kJ} / \mathrm{kg}, \mathrm{cp}_{\mathrm{H}_{2}}=4.181 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg} * \mathrm{~K}$ and $\mathrm{cp}_{\mathrm{g}}=1.98 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg} * \mathrm{~K}$.
The oxygen-containing gas is generally air or air enriched with oxygen.

As the atomization gas, it is possible to use a reactive gas such as air, air enriched with oxygen and/or an inert gas such as nitrogen in embodiments of the process of the invention. In general, air is used as atomization gas. The ratio of throughput of the cerium(III) solution/amount of atomization gas is preferably from 0.1 to $25 \mathrm{~kg} /$ standard $\mathrm{m}^{3}$ and particularly preferably from 0.5 to $5 \mathrm{~kg} /$ standard $\mathrm{m}^{3}$. One or more two-fluid or multifluid nozzles are particularly suitable for atomization. The atomization pressure is generally from 1 to 100 bar.

In a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, a fuel gas is additionally added to the reaction mixture. Suitable fuel gases include, e.g., hydrogen, methane, ethane, propane, butane, and natural gas. The amount of fuel gas added depends first and foremost on the amount of the solution

# US 7,553,465 B2 

## 5

containing the cerium(III) compound added, its composition and joule value. In general, the ratio of fuel gas/solution is from 0.1 to 2 standard $\mathrm{m}^{3} / \mathrm{kg}$.

It can also be advantageous for secondary air to be additionally introduced into the reaction chamber. In general, the amount of secondary air will be such that the ratio of secondary air to primary air is from 0.1 to 10 .

The process of the invention can preferably be carried out so that the proportion of oxygen in the amount of oxygencontaining gas introduced is greater than that necessary for complete reaction of the cerium(III) compound and the fuel gas. It is particularly advantageous for lambda to be $\geqq 1.5$, with lambda being calculated from the sum of oxygen in (air+i) appropriate atomization gas)/sum of (cerium(III) compound $\times$ fuel gas), in each case in mol/h. Very particular preference is given to $2<$ lambda $<5$.

As organic cerium(III) compounds, it is possible to use, e.g., in particular, cerium alkoxides and/or cerium carboxylates. As alkoxides, preference is given to using ethoxides, n-propoxides, isopropoxides, n-butoxides and/or tert-butoxides. As carboxylates, it is possible to use compounds based on acetic acid, propionic acid, butanoic acid, hexanoic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, octanoic acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, valeric acid, capric acid and/or lauric acid. It can be particularly advantageous to use 2-ethylhexanoates and/or laurates.

As organic solvents or as constituents of organic solvent mixtures, preference is given to using alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol or tert-butanol, diols such as ethanediol, pentanediol, 2-methyl-2,4pentanediol, dialkyl ethers such as diethyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether or tetrahydrofuran, $\mathrm{C}_{1}-\mathrm{C}_{12}$-carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butanoic acid, hexanoic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, octanoic acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, valeric acid, capric acid, lauric acid. Furthermore, it is possible to use ethyl acetate, benzene, toluene, naphtha and/or petroleum spirit. Preference is given to using solutions containing $\mathrm{C}_{2}-\mathrm{C}_{12}{ }^{-}$ carboxylic acids, in particular 2-ethylhexanoic acid and/or lauric acid.

The invention further provides a cerium oxide powder which has carbonate groups and is obtainable by the process of the invention.

The invention further provides a dispersion containing the cerium oxide powder having carbonate groups according to the invention.

The liquid phase of the dispersion can be water, one or more organic solvents or an aqueous/organic combination, with the phases preferably being miscible. The dispersion can additionally contain one or more of pH regulators, surfaceactive additives and/or preservatives. However, a dispersion containing surface-active additives is not advantageous. Instead, a dispersion which consists of only the cerium oxide powder having carbonate groups, water and optionally a pH regulator is advantageous.

The content of the cerium oxide powder containing carbonate groups in the dispersion can preferably be from 0.5 to $60 \%$ by weight. Particular preference is given to an aqueous dispersion containing from 20 to $50 \%$ by weight, in particular from 35 to $45 \%$ by weight, of the powder of the invention. Furthermore, an aqueous dispersion according to the invention which has a viscosity of $<30 \mathrm{mPas}$, particularly preferably $<20 \mathrm{mPas}$, at a concentration of the powder of up to $40 \%$ by weight and a temperature of $23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. in a shear rate range from 1 to $1000^{n-1}$ can be preferred.

The pH of an aqueous dispersion according to the invention is preferably in the range from 3 to 8 . To store the dispersion,
a pH of from 3 to 4 is usually set by addition of an acid. Nitric acid is particularly useful for this purpose. The stability of the dispersion is particularly high in this pH range.

When an aqueous dispersion is used as a polishing agent, a 5 pH of from 7 to 8 is preferred and can be set, for example, by means of ammonia or potassium hydroxide. The dispersion displays satisfactory stability in this range, even without the presence of surface-active additives.

A dispersion whose mean particle size $\mathrm{d}_{\mathrm{Si}}$, determined by 10 means of dynamic light scattering, is less than 120 nm , in particular less than 100 nm , is especially suitable for polishing processes.

Furthermore, a dispersion whose mean particle size $\mathrm{d}_{\mathrm{mi}}$, determined by means of dynamic light scattering, is less than 15 200 nm , in particular less than 150 nm , is suitable for this purpose.

The zeta potential of the dispersion of the invention is preferably at least 20 mV , in particular greater than 30 mV .

The dispersion of the invention can be produced by means 20 of dispersing apparatuses known to those skilled in the art. These can be, for example, rotor-stator machines, high-energy mills in which the particles are milled by collision with one another, planetary kneaders, stirred ball mills, vibratory ball mills, shaking tables, ultrasonic apparatuses or combinations of the abovementioned apparatuses.

## EXAMPLES

The specific surface area is determined in accordance with DIN 66131, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

The surface properties are determined by large-area ( 1 $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ ) XPS/ESCA analysis (XPS-X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy; ESCA-electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis). Evaluation is based on the general recommendations in 35 the DIN specialist report No. 39, DMA(A)97, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, of the National Physics Laboratory, Teddington, UK, and the previous findings on development-accompanying standardization of the working committee "Oberflächen- und Mikrobereichsanalysen" NMP816(DIN), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In addition, the comparative spectra available for the particular case from the specialist literature are taken into account. The values are calculated by background subtraction taking into account the relative sensitivity factors of the electron levels indicated in each case. The results are reported in percent by area. The accuracy is estimated as $\sqrt{ }-5 \%$ relative.

The zeta potential is determined in the pH range 3-12 by means of the electrokinetic sound amplitude (ESA). For this purpose, a suspension containing $1 \%$ of cerium oxide is prepared. Dispersion is carried out by means of an ultrasonic rod ( 400 W ). The suspension is stirred by means of a magnetic stirrer and pumped by means of a peristaltic pump through the PPL-80 sensor of the ESA-8000 instrument from Matec. From the starting pH value, the potentiometric titration is 5 carried out using 5 M NaOH to pH 12 . The backtitration to pH 4 is carried out using $5 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{HNO}_{3}$. Evaluation is carried out by means of the instrument software version pcava 5.94.

The dispersions are produced by ultrasound treatment in water using an ultrasonic finger (Bandelin UW2200/ DH13G), setting $8,100 \% ; 5$ minutes). The mean aggregate diameters are determined by means of a particle size analyser LB-500 from Horiba.

Example 1:
An aerosol produced from $250 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{h}$ of a solution comprising $50 \%$ by weight of cerium(III) ethylhexanoate and $50 \%$ by weight of 2 ethylhexanoic acid joule value of the solution: $29 \mathrm{~kJ} / \mathrm{kg}$ ), and 50 standard $\mathrm{m}^{3} / \mathrm{h}$ of atomization air was atomized into a reaction chamber by means of a two-fluid nozzle (from Schlick). Here, a hydrogen/oxygen flame composed of hydrogen ( 40 standard $\mathrm{m}^{3} / \mathrm{h}$ ) and primary air ( 1800 standard $\mathrm{m}^{3} / \mathrm{h}$ ) was burned and the aerosol was reacted in this. In addition, secondary air ( 3200 standard $\mathrm{m}^{3} / \mathrm{h}$ ) was introduced into the reaction chamber. The residence time in the flame was about 20 ms . The temperature 0.5 m below the flame was $1100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

An aerosol produced from $900 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{h}$ of water was subsequently sprayed into the reaction chamber by means of a two-fluid nozzle using 200 standard $\mathrm{m}^{3} / \mathrm{h}$ of atomization air at an inlet temperature of $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The solid product was separated off from gaseous substances on a filter. The reaction mixture had a temperature of $280^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. at this point in time. The residence time of the reaction mixture in the reaction chamber was 1 s .

Examples 2 to 4 were carried out in a manner analogous to Example 1, with the amounts used and other process parameters being shown in Table 1. The analytical data for the powders obtained are shown in Table 2.

The results of the XPS/ESCA analysis show that very pure surfaces are present. Apart from $\mathrm{Ce}, \mathrm{C}$ and O , no further elements are detectable. The carbonate C displays a bond energy of about 289 eV .

Furthermore, the $\mathrm{d}_{50}$ and $\mathrm{d}_{90}$ values of the $1 \%$ dispersions of the powders from Examples 1 to 4 are shown in Table 2.

The particle size distribution of a $5 \%$ dispersion of the powder from Example 3 in water whose pH has been set to 3.9 by means of $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ gave a $\mathrm{d}_{50}$ of 82 nm and a $\mathrm{d}_{90}$ of 103 nm .
$\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surfaces can be polished using the dispersion according to the invention and removal rates of $>500 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$, preferably up to $1,200 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$, in particular $1,000 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$, at a pv of $60,000 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{ms}$ are achieved.

FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 show polishing results of a $0.5 \%$ dispersion of the powder from Example 3 whose pH has been set to 7.6 by means of KOH .

FIG. 1 shows the removal rate, in $\mathrm{nm} / \mathrm{min}$, as a function of the product of contact pressure and velocity, in $\mathrm{N} / \mathrm{ms}$.

In addition, it was found that the motor currents measured in the polishing of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Si}_{3} \mathrm{~N}_{4}$ differed from one another when the dispersion according to the invention was used. This can be advantageously utilized in STI (shallow trench isolation). The objective of STI is to polish $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ very selectively and to stop the polishing process when the nitride layer is reached. It is known that additives which increase this selectivity by protecting the nitride can be added to a dispersion for this purpose. Surprisingly, these additives are not necessary in the case of the dispersion of the invention.

FIG. 2 shows the motor current as a function of time in s for $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Si}_{3} \mathrm{~N}_{4}$.
