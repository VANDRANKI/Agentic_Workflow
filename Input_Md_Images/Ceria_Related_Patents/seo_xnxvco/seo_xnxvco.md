CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION

This U.S. non-provisional patent application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2019-0136526, filed on Oct. 30, 2019, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.

## FIELD

The present disclosure relates to chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) slurry compositions, such as CMP slurry compositions for polishing an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, and to methods of fabricating a semiconductor device using such compositions.

## BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

As an integration density of a semiconductor device increases, there is an increasing demand for fine patterns and multi-layered circuitry. To meet such a demand, it is necessary to use layers, whose etch rates are different from each other. One such layer is an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer, which has transparent and conductive properties. The ITO layer is widely used for an electronic device (e.g., an image sensor, an electric mirror, and so forth) requiring a transparent property.

## SUMMARY

An embodiment of the inventive concepts provides a CMP slurry composition, which can be used to effectively polish an ITO layer and can have a high polishing rate and/or high polishing selectivity with respect to a polishing stop layer.

An embodiment of the inventive concepts provides a method of fabricating a semiconductor device using a CMP slurry composition.

According to an embodiment of the inventive concepts, a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) slurry composition for polishing an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer may include a polishing particle, a dispersing agent, an auxiliary oxidizing agent, and a sugar alcohol compound.

According to an embodiment of the inventive concepts, a method of fabricating a semiconductor device may include providing a substrate comprising a polishing stop layer on a lower layer, etching the polishing stop layer and at least a portion of the lower layer to form a trench, forming a transparent electrode layer on the polishing stop layer to fill the trench, and performing a CMP process on the transparent electrode layer using a CM' slurry composition as described herein to expose the polishing stop layer and to form a first transparent electrode in the trench. In some embodiments, the method comprises forming the polishing stop layer on the lower layer.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

Example embodiments of the inventive concepts will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which example embodiments are shown.

As used herein, "and/or" refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one or more of the associated listed items, as well as the lack of combinations when interpreted in the alternative ("or").

FIGS. $\mathbf{1}$ and $\mathbf{2}$ are sectional views illustrating a method of fabricating a semiconductor device according to an embodiment of the inventive concepts. FIG. 3 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a chemical process that may occur at a portion 'P1' of FIG. 1. FIG. 4 is a conceptual diagram illustrating a chemical process that may occur at a portion 45 'P2' of FIG. 2.

Referring to FIG. 1, a lower layer $\mathbf{1}$ may be provided and/or prepared. The lower layer $\mathbf{1}$ may be a semiconductor substrate, an interlayered insulating layer, a protection layer, a conductive layer, or an insulating substrate. For example, the lower layer $\mathbf{1}$ may be formed of and/or comprise silicon, silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, poly-silicon, and/or metal-containing materials. A polishing stop layer 3 may be provided and/or formed on the lower layer 1. The polishing stop layer 3 may be formed of and/or comprise a silicon nitride layer, a silicon oxynitride layer, or a silicon oxide layer. In some embodiments, the polishing stop layer 3 may comprise and/or be formed of silicon nitride.

The polishing stop layer 3 and the lower layer 1 may be partially etched to form a trench 5. A transparent electrode layer 7 may be on the lower layer $\mathbf{1}$ and in the trench $\mathbf{5}$. In some embodiments, the transparent electrode layer 7 may cover and/or be formed to cover the entire top surface of the lower layer 1 provided with the trench 5. The transparent electrode layer 7 may be formed of and/or comprise an inorganic conductive oxide. For example, the transparent electrode layer 7 may be formed of and/or comprise an indium tin oxide (ITO) layer. The transparent electrode layer

7 may fill the trench 5 . The ITO layer may be formed by a deposition process, such as a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process or an atomic layer deposition (ALD).

A chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) slurry composition according to the inventive concepts may be used to polish an ITO layer. For example, a CMP slurry composition may be used to perform a CMP process on the transparent electrode layer 7. In this case, as shown in FIG. 2, the transparent electrode layer 7 may be removed from the top surface of the polishing stop layer 3, and a transparent electrode $7 p$ may be formed in the trench 5 . The CMP slurry composition according to the inventive concepts may include a polishing particle, a dispersing agent, an auxiliary oxidizing agent, and a sugar alcohol compound.

The sugar alcohol compound may be a polyhydric alcohol including two or more hydroxyl groups ( -OH ). In some embodiments, the sugar alcohol compound may be at least one selected from maltitol, lactitol, threitol, erythritol, ribitol, xylitol, arabitol, adonitol, sorbitol (glucitol), talitol (altritol), mannitol, iditol, allodulcitol, dulcitol, galactitol, sedoheptitol (volemitol), and perseitol. In some embodiments, the sugar alcohol compound may be present in the CMP slurry composition in an amount of $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to 20 wt $\%$ relative to the total weight of the composition. In some embodiments, the sugar alcohol compound may be present in the CMP slurry composition in an amount of $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to 5 wt $\%$ relative to the total weight of the composition.

In some embodiments, when the amount of the sugar alcohol compound is greater than $20 \%$ by weight of the composition, the ITO layer constituting the transparent electrode layer 7 may suffer from a reduction in polishing rate and/or deterioration in dispersion stability and/or when the amount of the sugar alcohol compound is smaller than $0.1 \%$ by weight of the composition, polishing selectivity with respect to the silicon nitride layer may be lowered. Thus, it may be important to maintain the content of the sugar alcohol compound within the above range. The sugar alcohol compound may be included in the CMP slurry composition to improve the polishing selectivity with respect to the silicon nitride layer.

The polishing particle may be a metal oxide, a metal oxide coated with an organic or inorganic material, and/or a metal oxide in a colloidal state. In some embodiments, the metal oxide may be at least one selected from silica, ceria, zirconia, alumina, titania, barium titania, germania, mangania, and magnesia. In some embodiments, the polishing particle may be present in the composition in an amount of $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $10 \mathrm{wt} \%$ relative to the total weight of the composition. The polishing particle may have a positively-charged surface. The polishing particle in the composition may be in a colloidal state. The polishing particle may have a size ranging from about 100 nm to about 200 nm .

In some embodiments, the dispersing agent may be at least one selected from benzoic acid, phenylacetic acid, naphthoic acid, mandelic acid, picolinic acid, dipicolinic acid, nicotinic acid, dinicotinic acid, isonicotinic acid, quinolinic acid, anthranilic acid, fusaric acid, phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, toluic acid, salicylic acid, nitrobenzoic acid, and pyridinedicarboxylic acid. In some embodiments, the dispersing agent may be present in the composition in an amount of $0.01 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $25 \mathrm{wt} \%$ relative to the total weight of the composition. In some embodiments, the dispersing agent may be present in the composition in an amount of $0.01 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $5 \mathrm{wt} \%$ relative to the total weight of the composition. An amino acid and/or carboxyl group in the dispersing agent may cause a charge interaction with a positive charge on the surface of the
polishing particle, and this may be used to effectively disperse the polishing particles in the composition and/or on a surface.

The auxiliary oxidizing agent may be an organic acid. For example, the auxiliary oxidizing agent may be at least one selected from pimelic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, adipic acid, oxalic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, lactic acid, glutaric acid, glycollic acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, hydroxybutyric acid, aspartic acid, itaconic acid, tricarballylic acid, suberic acid, sebacic acid, stearic acid, pyrroxic acid, acetoacetic acid, glyoxylic acid, azelaic acid, caprylic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, valeric acid, and palmitic acid. In some embodiments, the auxiliary oxidizing agent 15 may be present in the composition in an amount of 0.001 wt $\%$ to $2.5 \mathrm{wt} \%$ relative to the total weight of the composition. In some embodiments, the auxiliary oxidizing agent may be present in the composition in an amount of $0.001 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to 1.0 $\mathrm{wt} \%$ relative to the total weight of the composition. In some
20 embodiments, when the amount of the auxiliary oxidizing agent is greater than $1.0 \%$ by weight of the composition, the polishing particle may be cohered and a dispersibility thereof may be deteriorated and/or when the amount of the auxiliary oxidizing agent is smaller than $0.001 \%$ by weight 25 of the composition, the polishing rate of the ITO layer constituting the transparent electrode layer 7 may be rapidly decreased.

The CMP slurry composition may further include water. In some embodiments, water may be present in the composition in an amount of $42.5 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $99.789 \mathrm{wt} \%$ relative to the total weight of the composition. In some embodiments, the CMP slurry composition may have a pH value from 2 to 7. The zeta potential of the CMP slurry composition may range from +5 mV to +70 mV . The electric conductivity of 35 the CMP slurry composition may range from about 300 $\mathrm{mS} / \mathrm{cm}$ to about $500 \mathrm{mS} / \mathrm{cm}$.

In some embodiments, when a CMP process is performed using a CMP slurry composition of the inventive concepts, reactions illustrated in FIGS. 3 and/or 4 may take place on 40 the surface of the transparent electrode layer 7 (e.g., an ITO layer) and on the surface of the polishing stop layer 3, respectively.

Referring to FIG. 3, surface protonation of a surface of a transparent electrode layer 7 (e.g., a surface of an ITO layer) may occur in which oxygen atoms on the surface (e.g., see (a)) are bonded to hydrogen atoms to form OH groups as shown in (b). As an example, the transparent electrode layer 7 will be referred to as an ITO layer, particularly in reference to FIGS. 3 and 4. This surface protonation may occur due to 50 water present in the CMP slurry composition. A chelation reaction may take place on the surface of the ITO layer by the auxiliary oxidizing agent, which is present in the CMP slurry composition, thereby producing an ITO-chelator complex, as shown in (c), and such a complex may be removed 55 by a CMP process. In a CMP slurry composition according to the inventive concepts, an organic acid having a relatively weak acidity may be used as the auxiliary oxidizing agent; thus, it may be possible to change the ITO layer to an easily-polishable layer by the chelation and/or to prevent the 60 ITO layer from being excessively corroded. Furthermore, due to the polishing particle (e.g., ceria) having a good mechanical property, it may be possible to secure a polishing rate in a process of polishing an ITO layer.

Referring to FIG. 4, if the top surface of the polishing stop 65 layer 3 is exposed by the above polishing process performed on the ITO layer, silicon and/or nitrogen atoms on the surface of the polishing stop layer 3, such as a silicon nitride

layer, may be bonded to the hydroxyl group in the sugar alcohol compound through hydrogen bonding, thereby forming on the polishing stop layer 3 a protection layer $3 p$ comprising the sugar alcohol compound. Accordingly, it may be possible to prevent the polishing stop layer 3 from being etched/polished and/or to reduce an etching/polishing rate of the polishing stop layer 3; thus, the polishing stop layer 3 may serve to stop polishing such as to stop polishing at the polishing stop layer 3, and thereby may serve as a stop layer. Owing to this mechanism, the use of a CMP slurry composition according to the inventive concepts may make it possible to prevent and/or suppress the polishing stop layer 3 from being damaged and/or to improve the polishing selectivity in the process of polishing the transparent electrode layer 7 (e.g., ITO layer). Accordingly, it may be possible to improve uniformity in surface roughness and/or a distribution in thickness of layers/patterns left after a CMP process. In some embodiments, a CMP slurry composition according to the inventive concepts may allow a transparent electrode layer 7 (e.g., an ITO layer) to be polished at polishing selectivity from $30: 1$ to $120: 1$, with respect to a polishing stop layer 3 such as a silicon oxide layer or a silicon nitride layer (polishing rate of the transparent electrode layer 7 ( $\AA / \mathrm{min})$ : polishing rate of the polishing stop layer $3(\AA / \mathrm{min}))$.

the ITO layer at a faster polishing rate and at a higher polishing selectivity when the CMP slurry compositions containing the sugar alcohol compound according to embodiments $1-20$ were used than when the compositions 5 according to comparative embodiments $1-4$ were used.

Table 4 shows that there was no significant difference in the polishing rate of the ITO layer between the comparative embodiments $1-4$ and embodiments $1-20$. However, the silicon nitride layers in the comparative embodiments $1-4$ were polished at very high rates of $109 \AA / \mathrm{min}$ to $127 \AA / \mathrm{min}$, whereas the silicon nitride layers in embodiments $1-20$ were polished at relatively slow rates of $23 \AA / \mathrm{min}$ to $69 \AA / \mathrm{min}$. As a result, the polishing selectivity (polishing rate of the ITO layer ( $\AA / \mathrm{min}$ ): polishing rate of the silicon nitride layer ( $\AA / \mathrm{min}$ )) was from 24 to 25 for comparative embodiments $1-4$ and was from 35 to 111 for embodiments $1-20$ in which the CMP slurry compositions comprising the sugar alcohol compound were used. This shows that it is possible to polish

As shown in Table 5, the concentrations of the picolinic acid, oxalic acid, and sorbitol were fixed to $15 \mathrm{wt} \%, 1.5 \mathrm{wt}$ $\%$, and $10 \mathrm{wt} \%$, whereas the concentration of the colloidal ceria was changed from $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $4 \mathrm{wt} \%$. The compositions for embodiments 21-27 had a substantially constant pH value (e.g., 3.21 to 3.33 ). The compositions for embodiments 21-27 had an electric conductivity ranging from about $373 \mathrm{mS} / \mathrm{cm}$ to $449 \mathrm{mS} / \mathrm{cm}$. In the compositions for embodiments 21-27, the ceria particle had a substantially constant size ranging from 141 nm to 143 nm . Table 5 shows that by using the compositions for the embodiments $21-27$, it is possible to polish the ITO layer at a fast polishing rate of 778 $\AA / \mathrm{min}$ or faster.

In general, it is difficult to polish or etch the ITO layer, due to its hard property. However, in the case where a CMP slurry composition according to the inventive concepts is used to perform a CMP process on an ITO layer, it may be possible to polish the ITO layer at a fast polishing rate and at a high polishing selectivity.

A CMP slurry composition according to the inventive concepts may be used for a CMP process, which is performed not only on the ITO layer but also on other inorganic conductive oxide layers.

In each of the pixels PX1 and PX2 on the sensor region SENSOR, a penetration electrode structure $\mathbf{1 5 0}$ may be formed to penetrate the substrate $\mathbf{1 0 0}$, and the penetration electrode structure $\mathbf{1 5 0}$ may be electrically connected to the storage node region $\mathbf{1 4 0}$. The penetration electrode structure $\mathbf{1 5 0}$ may include a penetration electrode $\mathbf{1 5 2}$ and a penetra-
tion electrode insulating layer 154, which is provided to enclose the penetration electrode 152.

A portion of the first surface $\mathbf{1 0 0} a$ of the substrate $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ on the pad region PAD may be etched to form a first trench T1.
A fixed charge layer $\mathbf{1 6 0}$ may be formed on the first surface $\mathbf{1 0 0} a$ of the substrate $\mathbf{1 0 0}$. The fixed charge layer $\mathbf{1 6 0}$ may be formed of and/or comprise one or more metal oxide(s), such as hafnium oxide and aluminum oxide. A back-side interconnection layer $\mathbf{3 0 5}$ may be formed on the pad region 10 PAD. The back-side interconnection layer $\mathbf{3 0 5}$ may be formed through depositing and etching processes. The backside interconnection layer $\mathbf{3 0 5}$ may be formed of and/or comprise a material containing a metal (e.g., titanium, tungsten, and aluminum). Although not shown, when the 15 back-side interconnection layer $\mathbf{3 0 5}$ is formed, a lightblocking pattern may be formed on the sensor region SENSOR to cover the first surface $\mathbf{1 0 0} a$ of the substrate $\mathbf{1 0 0}$. The light-blocking pattern may be overlapped with the deep device isolation part $\mathbf{1 3 2}$ and may have a mesh shape, when 20 viewed in a plan view.

A conductive pad $\mathbf{3 1 5}$ may be formed in the first trench T1 by, for example, depositing and etching processes. The conductive pad $\mathbf{3 1 5}$ may be in contact with the back-side interconnection layer 305. The conductive pad 315 may contain a metallic element (e.g., tungsten, copper, and aluminum). After the formation of the conductive pad 315, an anti-reflection layer $\mathbf{1 6 5}$ may be formed on the first surface $\mathbf{1 0 0} a$ of the substrate $\mathbf{1 0 0}$. The anti-reflection layer $\mathbf{1 6 5}$ may be formed of and/or comprise silicon nitride.

Optical filters $\mathbf{1 7 0} a$ and $\mathbf{1 7 0} b$ may be formed on the anti-reflection layer $\mathbf{1 6 5}$, and in some embodiments, each of the optical filters $\mathbf{1 7 0} a$ and $\mathbf{1 7 0} b$ may be formed on a corresponding one of the pixels PX1 and PX2 and on the sensor region SENSOR. Each of the optical filters $\mathbf{1 7 0} a$ and $\mathbf{1 7 0} b$ may be a color filter (e.g., of red, blue, or green) or an infrared filter. At least one of the optical filters $\mathbf{1 7 0} a$ and $\mathbf{1 7 0} b$ may be transparent. The optical filters $\mathbf{1 7 0} a$ and $\mathbf{1 7 0} b$ may be formed of and/or comprise photoresist patterns containing pigment.

After the formation of the optical filters $\mathbf{1 7 0} a$ and $\mathbf{1 7 0} b$, a back-side insulating layer $\mathbf{2 1 0}$ may be formed on the first surface $\mathbf{1 0 0} a$ of the substrate $\mathbf{1 0 0}$. The back-side insulating layer $\mathbf{2 1 0}$ may be formed of and/or comprise, for example, silicon oxide. A polishing stop layer $\mathbf{2 2 0}$ may be formed on the back-side insulating layer $\mathbf{2 1 0}$. The polishing stop layer $\mathbf{2 2 0}$ may be formed of and/or comprise, for example, silicon nitride.

The polishing stop layer $\mathbf{2 2 0}$ and the back-side insulating layer $\mathbf{2 1 0}$ on the sensor region SENSOR may be patterned to form a contact hole exposing the penetration electrode 152, and then, a lower contact plug $\mathbf{2 3 0}$ may be formed by filling the contact hole with a conductive layer.

The polishing stop layer $\mathbf{2 2 0}$ and the back-side insulating layer 210 may be etched to form a second trench T2 and a 55 third trench T3 on the sensor region SENSOR. Here, a portion of the lower contact plug $\mathbf{2 3 0}$ may be removed. A top surface of the lower contact plug $\mathbf{2 3 0}$ may be exposed through the second and third trenches T2 and T3. The second trench T2 may include in the first pixel PX1, and the third 60 trench T3 may be formed in the second pixel PX2. The second and third trenches T2 and T3 may not expose the optical filters $\mathbf{1 7 0} a$ and $\mathbf{1 7 0} b$.

After the formation of the second and third trenches T2 and T3, a transparent electrode layer $\mathbf{4 1 0}$ may be formed on 65 the first surface $\mathbf{1 0 0} a$ of the substrate $\mathbf{1 0 0}$. The transparent electrode layer $\mathbf{4 1 0}$ may be formed of and/or comprise an inorganic conductive oxide. For example, the transparent

electrode layer 410 may be formed of and/or comprise indium tin oxide (ITO). The transparent electrode layer 410 may be formed by a deposition process (e.g., CVD and/or ALD). The transparent electrode layer 410 may be formed to fill the second and third trenches T2 and T3.

Referring to FIG. 6, a CMP process may be performed on the transparent electrode layer 410 to expose the top surface of the polishing stop layer 220 and to form transparent pixel electrodes $410 a$ and $410 b$ in the second and third trenches T2 and T3, respectively, and in some embodiments, the CMP process may be performed using a CMP slurry composition according to the inventive concepts such as described with reference to FIGS. 1 to 4. The transparent pixel electrodes $410 a$ and $410 b$ may include a first transparent pixel electrode 410 a in the second trench T 2 and a second transparent pixel electrode 410 b in the third trench T3. Here, the top surface of the polishing stop layer 220 may be exposed, on the pad region PAD.

Next, an organic photoelectric conversion layer 420 and a transparent common electrode 430 may be sequentially formed on the transparent pixel electrodes 410 a and 410 b and on the sensor region SENSOR, and a micro lens array 440 may be formed on the transparent common electrode 430 to fabricate an image sensor. The transparent common electrode 430 may also be formed of and/or comprise an ITO layer. The organic photoelectric conversion layer 420 may include one or more organic material(s) of at least two different optical band gaps. The organic photoelectric conversion layer 420 may include a material, in which one or more kinds of polymers, oligomers, and/or polymer composites are included solely or in a mixed state. In some embodiments, the organic photoelectric conversion layer 420 may be formed of and/or comprise a mixture of donor/ acceptor polymers or at least one of n - and p-type organic semiconductor materials. In some embodiments, the organic photoelectric conversion layer 420 may include quantum dots or superfine particles, which have at least two different optical band gaps.

In some embodiments, when a CMP slurry composition according to the inventive concepts is used to polish an ITO layer, the transparent pixel electrodes 410 a and 410 b may be formed by the CMP process with high polishing selectivity. Thus, a residue of the ITO layer constituting the transparent electrode layer 410 may be prevented from being left on the pad region PAD. Furthermore, it may be possible to easily control the CMP process, to reduce a process time of a polishing process, and/or to improve a unit-per-equipmenthour (UPEH) property in the equipment for the CMP process compared to a CMP process that does not utilize a CMP slurry composition according to the inventive concepts. In addition, it may be possible to improve a variation in film quality of a layer to be polished, and this may make it possible to prevent the conductive pad 315 from being exposed by the CMP process.

If a CMP slurry composition is improperly used for the CMP process, a residue of the ITO layer constituting the transparent electrode layer 410 may be left on the pad region PAD, and in this case, a not-open issue may occur in a subsequent PAD open process. To avoid this issue, the transparent electrode layer 410 (e.g., the ITO layer) of the pad region PAD may be removed in advance, but in this case, an additional photolithography process may be needed to form a mask. That is, a fabrication process may be complex and may suffer from low productivity. By contrast, according to some embodiments of the inventive concepts, since a CMP slurry composition with high polishing selec-
tivity can be used to polish an ITO layer, it may be possible to avoid these issues and to simplify the fabrication process.

According to some embodiments of the inventive concepts, a CMP slurry composition for polishing an ITO layer 5 may include a polishing particle, a dispersing agent, an auxiliary oxidizing agent, and a sugar alcohol compound. By using the CMP slurry composition, an ITO layer may be polished at polishing selectivity of $30: 1$ to $120: 1$ with respect to a silicon oxide layer (polishing rate of the ITO layer ( $\AA / \mathrm{min}$ ):polishing rate of the silicon oxide layer $(\AA / \mathrm{min}))$ or with respect to a silicon nitride layer (polishing rate of the ITO layer ( $\AA / \mathrm{min}$ ): polishing rate of the silicon nitride layer ( $\AA / \mathrm{min})$ ). In addition, in the case where the CMP slurry composition is used to fabricate a semiconductor device, it may be possible to simplify a fabrication process and/or to reduce a process failure.
