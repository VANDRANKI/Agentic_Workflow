## CERIUM-BASED PARTICLE AND POLISHING SLURRY COMPOSITION INCLUDING THE SAME

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001] This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2021-00091762, filed on Jul. 13, 2021, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.

## BACKGROUND

1. Field of the Invention
[0002] One or more example embodiments relate to a new cerium-based particle and polishing slurry composition comprising the same.

## 2. Description of the Related Art

[0003] A chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process is performed by putting a slurry containing an abrasive particle on a substrate and using a polishing pad mounted on a polishing apparatus. Here, the abrasive particle is subjected to pressure from the polishing apparatus to mechanically polish a surface, and a chemical component included in the polishing slurry composition chemically reacts to the surface of the substrate to chemically remove the surface portion of the substrate.
[0004] In general, there are various types of polishing slurry compositions depending on the type and characteristics of an object to be removed. With a conventional slurry composition, there are problems in that a silicon oxide film, silicon nitride film, and polysilicon film cannot be selectively polished, a desired level of polishing speed cannot be obtained, or defects and scratches occur, and aggregation occurs due to low dispersion stability.
[0005] Because a dry ceria particle has an angular grain shape and wide particle size distribution due to limitations in the manufacturing method, micro-scratches are inevitable due to polishing process. Compared to the dry ceria particle, a wet ceria particle has a better particle distribution, less formation of large particles, and a polyhedral structure, so micro-scratches are largely overcome compared to the conventional dry ceria particle.
[0006] To reduce defects and scratches of the polishing film, and to improve dishing and erosion values in a pattern, the necessity of applying small-sized particles is increasing. Also, the demand for securing a stable and high polishing rate for oxide layer and poly layer is increasing, and it is necessary to develop abrasive particles that may easily secure polishing performances suitable for each semiconductor process and control dispersion stability.

[0031] It will be understood that when a certain part "includes" a certain component, the part does not exclude
another component but may further include another component, unless the context clearly dictates otherwise.
[0032] Hereinafter, a new cerium-based particle and a polishing slurry composition including the same will be described in detail with reference to example embodiments. However, the present disclosure is not limited to such example embodiments.
[0033] The present disclosure relates to a new ceriumbased particle, and according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure, the cerium-based particle is a selfassembly of fine particles, is a crystalline particle in which the fine particles are connected by physical and/or chemical treatment, has abrasive properties for a CMP process by modification of the surface, pore characteristics, particle size, constituents and others of the cerium-based particle, and may provide polishing properties suitable for a polishing object and purpose.
[0034] According to an example embodiment of the present disclosure, the cerium-based particle may include a self-assembly of fine particles and an organic material.
[0035] As an example of the present disclosure, the organic material may be included in the surface, inside the cerium-based particle, or both in the surface and inside the cerium-based particle; for example, a self-assembly. The organic material is carbon and may be included in the cerium-based particle by 0.05 wt $\%$ to 0.4 wt $\%$. When included in the content range, the organic material may be advantageous in providing excellent polishing properties in a CMP process and a desired polishing performance depending on a target CMP object.
[0036] As an example of the present disclosure, the cerium-based particle may be a spherical ceria powder connected by a crystalline network by self-assembled fine particles, and the sphericity of the cerium-based particle may be 0.4 or higher; 0.6 or higher; or 0.7 or higher, to achieve a high polishing speed in the CMP process and reduce defects and scratches in the target polishing layer.
[0037] As an example of the present disclosure, the cerium-based particle is porous and has a BET specific surface area of $120 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ to $180 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$, or $130 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ to 160 $\mathrm{m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$, and may have a density of $5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to $7.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$, or $5$ $\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ to $6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$.

In other words, before the heat treat-

ment, the fine particles are non-agglomerated particles formed by the initial reaction and are self-assembled by physical and chemical properties.

If the content of the abrasive particles is included within the above range, it is advantageous in securing a high polishing speed of the target polishing layer, and may prevent a decrease in stability due to an increase in abrasive particle content, and reduce the occurrence of dishing, scratches, and the like.
[0043] According to an example embodiment of the present disclosure, the slurry may further include a pH adjusting agent, which may include an acidic material, a basic material, or both acidic and basic materials.
[0044] For example, the acidic material may include one or more from the group of hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, hydrofluoric acid, bromic acid, iodic acid, formic acid, malonic acid, maleic acid, oxalic acid, acetic acid, adipic acid, citric acid, propionic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, salicylic acid, pimelic acid, benzoic acid, succinic acid, phthalic acid, butyric acid, glutaric acid, glutamic acid, glycolic acid, aspartic acid, tartaric acid and a salt of the same.
[0045] For example, the basic material may include one or more from the group of ammonia, Ammonium Methyl Propanol (AMP), Tetra Methyl Ammonium Hydroxide (TMAH), ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, rubidium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate, and imidazole.

The pH may be adjusted by the addition of a pH adjusting agent, and the polishing slurry composition may adjust the pH range according to the target polishing layer and thus procure a sufficient polishing speed, and prevent defects such as damage of a substrate, inconsistent roughness of a surface, dishing, erosion, corrosion, and surface imbalance.
[0047] According to an example embodiment of the present disclosure, the polishing slurry composition may control the polishing speed in the CMP process based on the physical properties of the cerium-based particle according to an example embodiment of the present disclosure, such as, the content of residual carbon. For example, the polishing slurry composition may increase the polishing speed of a target polishing layer, for example, an oxide film, an insulating film, or both the oxide film and the insulating film, or may refer to an automatic polishing stop function for a nitride film or a polysilicon film.
[0048] As an example of the present disclosure, the polishing slurry composition may polish a substrate including an oxide layer, a nitride layer and/or a poly layer in a CMP process, and the polishing speed for the oxide layer may be $2,500 \AA / \mathrm{min}$ or more, and the polishing speed for the nitride layer may be $100 \AA / \mathrm{min}$ or less, and the polishing speed for the poly layer may be $100 \AA / \mathrm{min}$ or less.
[0049] Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described in more detail through example embodiments, but the following examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.
