A slurry composition according to an embodiment of the present invention has a total amount of $100 \%$ and includes abrasives, an acid-base pH adjustor, an oxidant and water.

A polydisperse index of abrasives sizes is greater than 1.8 , so that a speed of the slurry composition removing a film is effectively enhanced. For example, a removal rate of the slurry composition to a dielectric material is enhanced to greater than 1000 angstroms/minute. The abrasive sizes are, for example, 20 nm to 100 nm .

The polydisperse index is defined as follows.
A cumulative quantity analysis is, in reality, a polynomial of a logarithm complying with a G1 correlation function, as shown in the following.
$L n /[G 1]-a+b t+c t^{2}+d t^{2}+e t^{4}+...$
The polydisperse index is defined as $2 \mathrm{e} / \mathrm{b}^{2}$. Wherein, b is a second order cumulant or named as a $z$-average diffusion coefficient, and c is a coefficient of a square term. Calculation of the above parameter is clearly defined in ISO standard 35 document 13321:1996E.

A content of the abrasives is $10 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $40 \mathrm{wt} \%$. According to another embodiment, the content of the abrasives is 15 wt $\%$ to $35 \mathrm{wt} \%$. A material of the abrasives is, for example, a silicon dioxide, a metal oxide, a polymer material or hybrids 40 of metal oxides and polymer materials. The silicon dioxide is, for example, fumed silica, colloidal silica, or silica sols. The colloidal silica may be obtained through hydrolysis of sodium silicate or potassium silicate or through hydrolysis and polycondensation of silanes. The metal oxide is, for example, 45 precipitated alumina, fumed alumina, precipitated titania or fumed titania.

The content of the acid-base pH adjustor is $0.01 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to 10 $\mathrm{wt} \%$. According to another embodiment, the composition of the acid-base pH adjustor is $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $5 \mathrm{wt} \%$. The acid-base pH adjustor adjusts a pH value of the slurry composition to, for example, pH 9 to 12 . According to another embodiment, the acid-base pH adjustor may adjust the pH value of the slurry composition to pH 10.5 to 11.5 .

A remaining portion of the slurry composition is water. The water is, for example, deionized water.

In addition, the slurry composition may further include a complexing agent, so as to further enhance a speed of removing the film. When the slurry composition includes the complexing agent, the polishing selectivity ratio of the barrier material to the metal material is lowered to less than or equal to 1.2 , and the polishing selectivity ratio of the dielectric material to the metal material is lowered to less than 2 .

A content of the complexing agent is 10 ppm to 500 ppm . In addition, the content of the complexing agent may be 70 ppm to 500 ppm . According to another embodiment, the content of the complexing agent may be 70 ppm to 300 ppm .

The complexing agent is, for example, at least one of citric acid, oxalic acid, ammonium oxalate, tartaric acid, histidine, alanine and glycine.

As known from the above, in the slurry composition provided by the present invention, since the polydisperse index of the abrasives sizes is greater than 1.8 , the speed of removing the film is enhanced.

In addition, when the slurry composition further includes the complexing agent, the speed of removing the film is further enhanced. Moreover, when the slurry composition includes the complexing agent, the polishing selectivity ratio of the barrier material to the metal material and the polishing selectivity ratio of the dielectric material to the metal material are lowered.

The metal layer 108" is the damascene structure.

The slurry composition used in the second CMP process includes the abrasives, the acid-base pH adjustor, the oxidant and the water and may further include the complexing agent. The compositions, contents and functions of the slurry composition have already been described in detail in the previous embodiments, so that repeated descriptions are omitted here.

ishing selectivity ratio of the dielectric material (TEOS silicon oxide) to the metal material (copper) and lowers the polishing selectivity ratio of the barrier material (tantalum, tantalum nitride) to the metal material (copper). In addition, increasing the content of the complexing agent in the slurry composition increases the removal rate to the dielectric material (TEOS silicon oxide).
