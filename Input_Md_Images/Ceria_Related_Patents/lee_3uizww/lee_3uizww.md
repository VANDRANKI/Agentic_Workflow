[0030] A CMP slurry composition for polishing a tungsten pattern wafer may help improve polishing rate and flatness of a tungsten pattern wafer when silica modified with a silane containing two nitrogen atoms or silica modified with a silane containing three nitrogen atoms is used as an abrasive agent in the CMP slurry composition. In an implementation, in the CMP slurry composition, a composition of Formula 3 may be used as a biocide to provide biocidal effects without deterioration in polishing rate and flatness due to the abrasive agent.
[0031] A CMP slurry composition for polishing a tungsten pattern wafer according to an (hereinafter, "CMP slurry composition") may include, e.g., a solvent (e.g., a polar solvent or a non-polar solvent); an abrasive agent; and a biocide. In an implementation, the abrasive agent may include, e.g., silica modified with a silane containing two nitrogen atoms or silica modified with a silane containing three nitrogen atoms. In an implementation, the biocide may include, e.g., a compound of Formula 3 described below.
[0032] Hereinafter, components of the CMP slurry composition according to an embodiment will be described in detail.

The solvent may include, e.g., water (e.g., ultrapure water or deionized water), an organic amine, an organic alcohol, an organic alcohol amine, an organic ether, an organic ketone, or the like. In an implementation, ultrapure water or deionized water may be used. The solvent may be included in a balance amount in the CMP slurry composition.
[0034] Abrasive Agent
[0035] The abrasive agent may help polish an insulating layer (e.g., a silicon oxide layer) and a tungsten pattern wafer at a high polishing rate.
[0036] The abrasive agent may include, e.g., silica modified with a silane containing two nitrogen atoms and or silica modified with a silane containing three nitrogen atoms. The modified silica may include, e.g., spherical or non-spherical particles, in which primary particles may have an average particle diameter (D50) of about 10 nm to about 200 nm , e.g., about 20 nm to about 180 nm or about 30 nm to about 150 nm . Within this range, the CMP slurry composition may help secure a sufficient polishing rate of the insulating layer and the tungsten pattern wafer, which are polishing targets, without generating surface defects (e.g., scratches and the like) after polishing.
[0037] The "average particle diameter (D50)" means the diameter of particles corresponding to $50 \mathrm{wt} \%$ in a weight distribution of the abrasive agent.
[0038] In the CMP slurry composition, the abrasive agent, e.g., the silica modified with a silane containing two nitrogen or the silica modified with a silane containing three nitrogen atoms, may be present in an amount of, e.g., about 0.001 wt $\%$ to about $20 \mathrm{wt} \%$, about $0.01 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to about $10 \mathrm{wt} \%$, about $0.05 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to about $3 \mathrm{wt} \%$, or about $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to about $3 \mathrm{wt} \%$ (e.g., based on a total weight of the CMP slurry composition). Within this range, the CMP slurry composition may help secure a sufficient polishing rate of the insulating layer and the tungsten pattern wafer while securing slurry dispersion stability without generating scratches. In an implementation, the abrasive agent may be present in an amount of, e.g., about $0.001 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.002 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.003 \mathrm{wt}$ $\%, 0.004 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.005 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.006 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.007 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.008$ $\mathrm{wt} \%, 0.009 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.01 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.02 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.03 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.04$ $\mathrm{wt} \%, 0.05 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.06 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.07 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.08 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.09 \mathrm{wt}$ $\%, 0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.2 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.3 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.4 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.5 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.6$ $\mathrm{wt} \%, 0.7 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.8 \mathrm{wt} \%, 0.9 \mathrm{wt} \%, 1 \mathrm{wt} \%, 2 \mathrm{wt} \%, 3 \mathrm{wt}$ $\%, 4 \mathrm{wt} \%, 5 \mathrm{wt} \%, 6 \mathrm{wt} \%, 7 \mathrm{wt} \%, 8 \mathrm{wt} \%, 9 \mathrm{wt} \%, 10 \mathrm{wt}$ $\%, 11 \mathrm{wt} \%, 12 \mathrm{wt} \%, 13 \mathrm{wt} \%, 14 \mathrm{wt} \%, 15 \mathrm{wt} \%, 16 \mathrm{wt}$ $\%, 17 \mathrm{wt} \%, 18 \mathrm{wt} \%, 19 \mathrm{wt} \%,$ or $20 \mathrm{wt} \%$, in the composition.
[0039] The abrasive agent may include the silica modified with a silane containing two nitrogen atoms and or the silica modified with a silane containing two nitrogen atoms. The modified silica may help achieve a remarkable improvement in polishing rate and flatness while suppressing generation of scratches, as compared with non-modified silica or silica modified with an amino silane containing one nitrogen atom. In an implementation, the modified silica may help realize a high polishing rate of the tungsten pattern wafer in a sub-acidic pH condition, as compared with in a strongly acidic condition.
[0040] The modified silica may have a positive charge on a surface thereof and may have a surface potential of about 10 mV to 60 mV . Within this range, the composition may help achieve improvement in flatness without generating surface defects after polishing.
[0041] In an implementation, silica may be modified with an amino silane containing two nitrogen atoms or an amino silane containing three nitrogen atoms, described below in detail.
[0042] The silica modified with a silane containing two nitrogen atoms or a silane containing three nitrogen atoms may be obtained by adding a modification target compound, a cation thereof, or a salt thereof to non-modified silica, followed by reaction for a predetermined period of time. The non-modified silica may include, e.g., colloidal silica or fumed silica. In an implementation, the non-modified silica may include, e.g., colloidal silica.

[0123] (1) Suppression of microorganism and fungi was evaluated on the CMP slurry compositions prepared in the Examples and Comparative Examples under the following polishing conditions. Results are shown in Table 1.
[0124] Fungi contamination area and microorganism contamination area (unit: \%): A mixture prepared by stirring $1,000 \mathrm{~g}$ of the CMP slurry composition prepared in each of the Examples and Comparative Examples at 2,000 rpm in a 2 L flask for 2 hours and dispersed by a high pressure dispersion method, thereby preparing a slurry. A sample was prepared by filtering the slurry through a filter having a pore size of $0.2 \mu \mathrm{~m}$.
[0125] After contaminating the prepared sample with Aspergillus niger, 0.5 ml of the sample was cultivated on a Potato Dextrose Agar medium (PDA medium, 3M) at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. for 10 days, followed by calculating a ratio (\%) of the total area of the cultivated fungi to the total area of the medium as the fungi contamination area.
[0126] After contaminating the prepared sample with bacteria or other microorganism (Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans), 0.5 ml of the sample was cultivated on a Plate Count Agar medium (PDA medium, 3M) at $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. for 10 days, followed by calculating a ratio (\%) of the total area of the cultivated microorganism to the total area of the medium as the microorganism contamination area.
[0127] (2) Polishing evaluation was carried out on the CMP slurry compositions prepared in the Examples and Comparative Examples under the following polishing conditions. Results are shown in Table 1.
[0128] [Polishing Evaluation Condition]
[0129] 1. Polishing machine: Reflexion 300 mm (AMAT Co., Ltd.)
[0130] 2. Polishing condition
[0131] Polishing pad: VP3100/Rohm and Haas Company
[0132] Head speed: 35 rpm
[0133] Platen speed: 33 rpm
[0134] Pressure: 1.5 psi
[0135] Retainer Ring Pressure: 8 psi
[0136] Slurry flow rate: $250 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$
[0137] Polishing time: 60 sec
[0138] 3. Polishing target
[0139] A commercially available tungsten pattern wafer (MIT 854, 300 mm ) was used.
[0140] A mixture was prepared by mixing a CMP slurry for tungsten polishing (STARPLANAR7000, Samsung SDI Co., Ltd.) with deionized water in a weight ratio of $1: 2$, and hydrogen peroxide was added to the mixture in an amount of $2 \mathrm{wt} \%$ based on the weight of the mixture, thereby preparing a mixed solution, which in turn was used to polish a tungsten pattern wafer. The tungsten pattern wafer was polished on a polishing machine (Reflexion LK300 mm) using an IC1010/SubaIV Stacked polishing pad (Rodel Co., Ltd.) for 60 seconds under conditions of a head speed of 101 rpm , a platen speed of 33 rpm , a polishing pressure of 2 psi , a retainer ring pressure of 8 psi , and a mixed solution flow rate of $250 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. Polishing was performed to remove a tungsten metal layer until oxide/metal patterns were exposed.
[0141] 4. Analysis method
[0142] Relative oxide polishing rate (unit: \%): An oxide polishing rate (unit: $\AA / \mathrm{min}$ ) was obtained based on a difference in film thickness before and after polishing, as measured using a reflectometer under the above polishing conditions.
[0143] The composition of Comparative Example 1 had an oxide polishing rate of $120 \AA / \mathrm{min}$ (which served as a reference polishing rate).
[0144] Relative oxide polishing rate was calculated by the following equation: $\{$ (oxide polishing rate in application of compositions of each of the Examples and Comparative Examples)/(oxide polishing rate in application of composition of Comparative Example 1) $\} \times 100$.
[0145] Relative Flatness (unit: \%): After polishing a wafer using the CMP slurry compositions prepared in each of the Examples and Comparative Examples under the above polishing conditions, a profile of a pattern was measured using an Insight CAP Compact Atomic Profiler (Bruker Co., Ltd.). Erosion (unit: $\AA$ ) was calculated based on a difference in height between peri-oxide and cell-oxide in a $0.18 / 0.18 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ pattern region of the polished wafer. A scanning speed was set to $100 \mu \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$ and a scan length was set to 2 mm .
[0146] The composition of Comparative Example 1 had an erosion of $50 \AA$ (which served as a reference erosion).
[0147] Relative flatness was calculated by the following equation: $\{$ (erosion in application of composition of each of Examples and Comparative Examples)/(erosion in application of composition of Comparative Example 1) $] \times 100$

[0148] As may be seen in Table 1, the CMP slurry composition according to the Examples achieved an improvement in stability of the composition with respect to fungi and other microorganisms by suppressing growth of the fungi and other microorganisms. In addition, the CMP slurry composition according to the Examples suffered from no or only insignificant deterioration in improvement in polishing rate and flatness of the tungsten pattern wafer, as compared with a CMP slurry composition free from the biocide.
[0149] On the contrary, the composition of Comparative Example 1 containing no biocide was unsuitable due to excessive growth of fungi and other microorganisms. In addition, the composition of each of Comparative Examples 2 to 6 prepared using biocides other than the compound of Formula 3 exhibited insignificant biocidal effects and/or no or insignificant improvement in polishing rate and flatness of the tungsten pattern wafer, as compared with a CMP slurry composition free from the biocide.
[0150] One or more embodiments may provide a CMP slurry composition for polishing a tungsten pattern wafer, which may help improve polishing rate and flatness of a tungsten pattern wafer while also improving stability with respect to microorganisms including, e.g., fungi and/or bacteria.
[0151] By way of summation and review, although some CMP slurry compositions may be used immediately after preparation thereof, some CMP slurry compositions may not be used immediately after preparation due to preparation, delivery, or the like. As a result, propagation of microorganisms could occur during a storage period of the CMP slurry composition, thereby causing, e.g., filter clogging upon filtration of the CMP slurry composition or deterioration in processability due to contamination of a semiconductor manufacturing facility.
[0152] One or more embodiments may provide a CMP slurry composition for polishing a tungsten pattern wafer, which has improved stability with respect to microorganisms including, e.g., fungi and/or bacteria.
[0153] One or more embodiments may provide a CMP slurry composition for polishing a tungsten pattern wafer, which may help improve polishing rate and flatness of a tungsten pattern wafer upon polishing of the tungsten pattern wafer.
