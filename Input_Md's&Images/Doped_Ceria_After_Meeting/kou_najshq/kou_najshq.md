#### Abstract

Ceria $\left(\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\right)$-based abrasives are widely utilized in ultra-precision grinding and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) applications over silica materials due to their unique physicochemical properties. Both mechanical and chemical contributions to polishing processes are highly affected by the size, shape, structure, component, defect of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives. Herein, the composites involved mesoporous silica $\left(\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}\right)$ cores and La- or Yb-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ shells were synthesized and characterized in terms of X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray mapping methods. The polishing effectiveness of the proposed composites toward quartz glass was experimentally evaluated under both CMP and ultraviolet irradiation-assisted photochemical mechanical polishing (PCMP) conditions. The polishing results indicated that the low-modulus $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ cores strongly exerted the cushion effects for the friction and abrasion to substrates. Consequently, the heterostructured $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive systems offered nearly non-damage and ultra-smooth surfaces with angstrom-level roughness compared to conventional rigid abrasives. The enriched $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy defects at La- and Yb - doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces were responsible for the improvements of tribochemical and photochemical activities, thus allowing evidently enhanced removal efficiency with the assistance of ultraviolet irradiation. A possible polishing mechanism on the multi-component abrasive systems was also proposed.


## 1. Introduction

Chemical mechanical polishing/planarization (CMP) [1-5] has emerged as an available and powerful technique for globally or locally smoothing and planarizing metals, ceramics, and polymers with surface roughness of sub-nanometer scale. CMP can be regarded as a complex chemical etching process (surface modification) and free abrasive polishing (material removal). Typically, these processes aim to minimize or even eliminate the surface and subsurface damage typically involved in mechanical abrasion and surface corrosion generated by etching. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to achieving both further high removal rate and high surface quality.

Complex polishing methods and systems pose both challenges and opportunities in comparison to the conventional CMP technique. Up to now, advanced oxidation process (ozone, photocatalysis, photo-Fenton,
electro-Fenton, Fenton-like, etc.), physical field and external energy (plasma, laser, ultraviolet radiation, thermal, ultrasonic, magnetic, electromagnetic, magnetorheological, electrochemical, photochemical, etc.) [6-12] have been introduced into traditional CMP processes for further improved performance. Among these new polishing techniques, ultraviolet irradiation-assisted photochemical mechanical polishing (PCMP) [13-24] has attracted growing interest in recent years and deserve more attention in system optimization, because it can be easily to be performed by installing a peripheral light source with a conventional polishing equipment. In the case of PCMP, highly reactive oxygen species (typically hydroxyl radicals) can be effectively produced in polishing slurries via photocatalysis and/or photo-Fenton reactions, thus softening the hard surface of substrate materials and accelerating the removal of the modified surface layers.

Polishing slurries commonly consist of liquid phase and solid phase,

except for some abrasive-free slurries. Liquid phase typically involves deionized water, oxidizers, dispersants, pH regulators, stabilizers, and other surfactants. Solid phase typically contains non-metallic oxides served as abrasive particles, for example, silica $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\right)$, ceria $\left(\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\right)$, alumina $\left(\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$, iron oxide $\left(\mathrm{Fe}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$, tin oxide $\left(\mathrm{SnO}_{2}\right)$, tungsten oxide $\left(\mathrm{WO}_{3}\right)$, zirconia $\left(\mathrm{ZrO}_{2}\right)$, yttria $\left(\mathrm{Y}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$, etc. Of these oxides, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is the most efficient abrasives in polishing slurries for processing silicainvolved materials due to its high tribochemical activity and removal efficiency.

Abrasive particles in polishing slurries are essential for CMP performance, even though their actual role is not entirely clear. It is commonly recognized that the size, composition, shape, hardness, modulus, and surface chemistry of abrasive particles are also thought to play a key role in CMP practices. Nevertheless, the most popular oxide abrasives still remain some challenges, for example, surface damage, surface roughness, removal selectivity, removal efficiency, etc. Fortunately, some of these shortcomings associated with the use of conventional abrasives can be effectively controlled by the introduction of novel abrasive systems. In the past decade, tremendous efforts have been made towards the development of mixed, modified, porous, nonspherical, and composite abrasives with well-designed size, morphology, structure as well as proper constituent and/or composition. Great progress has been achieved in developing $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-coated polymer [6], [16], [17], [18], [28], solid or mesoporous $\mathrm{SiO}_{2} \cdot[19], [20], [29]$, carbon [17], $\mathrm{ABN}[30]$ abrasive systems, due to their excellent properties such as rich surface defect, controlled porosity, low overall modulus, good dispersion stability, etc. Core/shell heterostructures [31], [32] with tunable compositions are attracting great interest because they can have functionalities in both the cores and the shells, making these materials applicable in advanced polishing practices. Nevertheless, there are still few reports focused on the PCMP practices over optical quartz glasses using $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-involved core/shell abrasive systems.

In this work, lanthanum (La)- or ytterbium (Yb)-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanocrystals were deposited on mesoporous silica ( $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ ) nanospheres using a facile in-situ chemical synthesis. The experimental evidences of defect evolution (typically $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy) in La- and Yb-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ were explored via Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffractometry, Xray photoelectron spectrometer, and high angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging operated in scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) mode. The resulting $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ composites were utilized as novel core/shell abrasive systems for improved polishing performance toward optical quartz glasses. The large $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ core aim to serve as a low-modulus carrier for the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles and brings them in contact with the substrates more gently and efficiently during polishing. Doping trivalent La or Yb ions in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice structures are expected to create more surface defects such as $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancies (VOs) [33], thus leading to the enhancement of tribochemical and photochemical activities. The superiority of the proposed abrasive systems was verified by comparing surface quality and removal rate with non-porous rigid $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based abrasives under both CMP and ultraviolet irradiation-assisted PCMP. Furthermore, a possible polishing mechanism was discussed in terms of interfacial abrasive-substrate contact, photochemical surface modification, and tribochemical material removal.

## 2. Experimental section

### 2.1. Materials and reagents

All chemicals used were obtained from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China), including cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{AR}$ ), lanthanum nitrate hexahydrate $\left(\mathrm{La}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right.$, AR), yttrium nitrate hexahydrate $\left(\mathrm{Yb}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right.$, AR), ethanol $\left(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6} \mathrm{O}\right.$, AR), acetone $\left(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6} \mathrm{O}\right.$, AR), hexamethylenetetramine $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{~N}_{4}\right.$, CP), hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}, 30 \mathrm{wt} \%, \mathrm{AR}\right)$, sodium hydroxide $(\mathrm{NaOH}$, AR), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, AR), sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS, AR), and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, AR). All chemicals were used as received without further purification.

### 2.2. Powder synthesis

All preparations were performed in an oil bath equipped with a temperature controller and a magnetic stirrer. In a typical synthesis procedure, spherical $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ particles (ca. 200 nm ) were first prepared via a templet-assisted Stöber method involved the interfacial assembly of CTAB/TEOS in ethanol/water mixed system, as described in our previous work [34]. Briefly, 0.2 g of $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ was dispersed into the 47.4 g of ethanol with ultrasound for 30 min . After that, a mixture of 0.5 g of Ce $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, 0.1 \mathrm{~g}$ of $\mathrm{La}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (or $\left.\mathrm{Yb}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right), 0.96 \mathrm{~g}$ of $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{~N}_{4}$ (as a precipitant), and 40 g of deionized water was added to the above solution and stirred constantly for 30 min , respectively. Subsequently, the suspension was heated to $75^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in an oil bath and maintained for 2 h under magnetic stirring ( $300 \mathrm{r} / \mathrm{min}$ ). The resulting products were centrifuged, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and dried in an oven. Finally, the $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ samples were obtained by annealing the products in air at $650^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 2 h with a heating rate of $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{min}^{-1}$. Herein, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ (or $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ ) cations were mixed at the stoichiometric molar ratio of 0.85: 0.15, i.e., the doping amounts in $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanocrystals were set at ca. $15 \%$. For comparison, the undoped $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ composites were also fabricated. In addition, the solid silica $\left(\mathrm{sSiO}_{2}\right)$ involved non-porous $\mathrm{sSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles with comparable core size and shell thickness were prepared using a similar procedure mentioned above.

### 2.3. Powder characterization

Phase identification was performed via X-ray diffractometry (XRD) on a Rigaku D/Max 2500 PC diffractometer operated at $40 \mathrm{kV} / 120 \mathrm{~mA}$ using nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation $(1.54056 \AA)$ in the range of $2 \theta=$ $20^{\circ}-80^{\circ}$ with a scanning speed of $10^{\circ} / \mathrm{min}$ and an acquisition step of $0.02^{\circ}(2 \theta)$. Lattice parameters of the (La- and Yb-) doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ were determined by fitting the observed reflections with a least-squares refinement program. Crystallite sizes were calculated by the X-ray line-broadening technique performed on the (111) diffraction using the Scherrer equation ( $D=0.9 \lambda / j \cos \theta$ ), where $D$ is the average crystallite size, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of incident X-rays $(1.54056 \AA), \beta$ is the corrected half-width, and $\theta$ is the diffraction angle.

Particle morphology and agglomeration of the as-synthesized powders were characterized with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Model: SUPRAS5, Zeiss). The powder samples were ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol, and the suspension was spread on the surface of a polished silicon wafer. After drying in air, a thin layer of gold was coated on the sample surface for conductivity before observation. The particle size distributions of the samples were analyzed using image analysis software (Nano Measurer V1.2). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and selected-area electron diffraction (SEAD) patterns were obtained by a JEOL JEM-2100 high-resolution (HR) TEM apparatus. Energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS) analysis was conducted with an equipped Oxford EDS detector. A FEI Talos 200 s microscope (equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) detector) with a high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) function was used for acquiring elemental maps. All samples dispersing in aqueous solution were deposited a single drop on copper grids for TEM observations. Raman spectroscopy analyses were performed on a DXR Raman spectroscope (ThermoFisher, UK) with an excitation laser wavelength of 532 nm in the range of $200-800 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. Zeta potential measurements were carried out on a Nano-ZS Zetasizer (Malvern, UK). The surface composition and of oxidation state the samples were analyzed using a UlvacPhi PHI-5000 VP III X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) with Al K $\alpha$ X-ray source ( $h v=1486.6 \mathrm{eV}$ ). And the C 1 s reference at 284.8 eV was used for the binding energy calibration.

### 2.4. Polishing experiments

The BK7 (K9) optical quartz glasses with a dimension of $20.0 \times 20.0$ $\times 2.0 \mathrm{~mm}$ was obtained from Kejing Materials Technology Co., Ltd. (Hefei, China), and utilized as substrates in all polishing tests. The surface morphology analysis of the as-received workpiece was performed using an atomic force microscope (AFM), revealing a rough appearance (Fig. 1) with an average surface roughness $\left(R_{\mathrm{a}}\right)$ of ca. 111 nm and a root-mean-square roughness $\left(R_{\mathrm{q}}\right)$ of ca. 137 nm . The corresponding profile curves show the maximum peak-to-valley (PV) value of ca. 344 nm . In this work, the sample quartz glasses underwent rough grinding/polishing and precision polishing procedures using a benchtop polisher (TegraForce-1/TrgraPol-15, Struers A/S, Denmark). In the rough polishing stage, the as-received quartz glasses were mechanically prefinished using commercial calcined $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives with mixed particle sizes ranged from 100 nm to 1000 nm (obtained from Changzhou Geoquin Nano New Material Co., Ltd.), which provided samples with reduced surface roughness for subsequent precision polishing processes. After 60-min rough polishing, the surface roughness of the quartz glass significantly reduced, as determined by a 3D noncontact interferometric microscope and an atomic force microscope.

Precision polishing tests were performed on a benchtop TegraForce-1/TrgraPol-15 polisher coupled with a MD-Chem porous polyurethane polishing pad (Struers A/S) and a 250-W halogen lamp (ultraviolet light source) with a wavelength of 365 nm for PCMP experiments. The schematic view of the ultraviolet irradiation-assisted PCMP apparatus was described in Fig. 2. The polishing was performed at a downforce of 3.0 psi with a coupon area of $20.0 \times 20.0 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$ and a polishing time of 30 min . The head/platen rotational speed was $120 / 90 \mathrm{rpm}$, and the slurry flow rate was $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ for all the experiments.

Polishing slurries were prepared with the $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{mSiO}_{2} /$ $\mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, or $\mathrm{sSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ composite abrasives at a concentration of 1.0 $\mathrm{wt} \%$ in deionized water. These slurries were then modified through pH adjustment (8.0-8.5) and the addition of oxidant $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}, 1.0 \mathrm{wt} \%\right)$ and surfactant (SDS, $0.5 \mathrm{wt} \%$ ). The dispersant aimed to enhance the dispensability of the abrasives in polishing slurries. The polishing slurries were irradiated with ultraviolet light for 10 min prior to PCMP experiments.

The BK7 substrates before and after polishing were ultrasonically
cleaned with deionized water and acetone, and then dried and stored in nitrogen prior to analysis. Surface morphology, defect, and roughness were investigated through an atomic force microscope (AFM, Nanoman VS, formerly Digital Instruments \& Veeco Instruments, equipped with a Dimension V controller) in tapping model using a commercial BudgetSensors Tap300AI-G silicon probe with a max tip radius of 10 nm . The scanning speed was 1.0 Hz , and the scanning areas with a resolution of $512 \mathrm{px} \times 512 \mathrm{px}$ were fixed at $5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m} \times 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. Five measurement positions from the edge to the center of every workpiece surface were randomly selected to ensure the credibility of the surface roughness determinations. The surface quality was evaluated in terms of $\mathrm{PV}, R_{\mathrm{q}}, R_{\mathrm{a}}$, surface area difference (SAD), etc. Material removal rates (RRs) were calculated in terms of the equation (1):
$R R=\Delta m / \rho z t(1)$
Herein, $\Delta \mathrm{m}$ is the difference in the workpiece weight measured using a Mettler Toledo XS105 analytical balance (accuracy of 0.01 mg ) before and after polishing, $\rho$ is the density of quartz glasses $\left(2.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\right), s$ is the workpiece area of optical quartz glasses, $t$ is the polishing time. The presented data (average surface roughness and $R R$, and its standard deviation) were calculated from three runs.

## 3. Results and discussion

### 3.1. Morphological, crystallographic and spectroscopic analyses

FESEM observations were utilized to examine the morphology and particle diameter change of $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ products. Prior to the synthesis of core/shell composites, monodispersed $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ spheres (Fig. 3a) were prepared as the core materials via a modified CTABassisted Stöber approach. After coating, the resulting $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (Fig. 3c) still remains well-defined spherical shapes with rough appearances, clearly indicating the presence of the grafted $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles. The particle-size distributions (Fig. 3b and d) of the samples were explored by Gauss fitting and counting $50 \mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ spheres taken from FESEM images. Corresponding average diameter sizes of experimentally obtained $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} /$ $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ were determined to be $208.1 \pm 24.9$ and $227.7 \pm 27.1 \mathrm{~nm}$, respectively. Obtained from the differences between the mean sizes of

$\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles, the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ shell thicknesses were estimated to be about 10 nm .

TEM investigations were performed to further investigate the presence of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanocrystals on the surfaces of $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ cores. By comparison with the smooth bare $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ (Fig. 4a) with relative-low electron contrast, the low-magnification TEM image of $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (Fig. 4b) reveals the formation of uniform spherical particles with rough appearances and relative-high electron contrast. The strawberry-like surfaces of $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ have a densely packed coverage of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles,
which agrees well with the FESEM results (Fig. 3). In addition, the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanoparticles involved in $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ composites are well-distributed on the shell surfaces and each consisted of many nanocrystals with a size range of approximately $2-5 \mathrm{~nm}$, as confirmed by high-magnification TEM analyses (Fig. 4c and d). The representative HRTEM images (Fig. 4e and f) taken from the La- and Ybdoped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ depict the distinct lattice fringes of ca. 0.33 and 0.32 nm , corresponding to the spacing of the (111) planes of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The crystalline nature of $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is also evidenced by the SAED pattern (Fig. 4g).

There are four diffraction rings can be indexed to (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystal planes of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, further verifying the polycrystalline characteristics. EDS measurement was performed at several locations throughout the specimens, and a representative EDS spectrum on $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, as shown in Fig. 4 b , demonstrated that cerium (Ce), lanthanum (La), silicon (Si), and oxygen (O) were electrodeposited. Result of the EDS analysis confirms that the existence of $\mathrm{Ce}, \mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Si}$, and O elements, which are in accordance with the starting materials involved in material preparations.

The structure and elemental distribution of an individual $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particle were characterized in terms of HAADF-STEM imaging in conjunction with EDX elemental mapping. Micrographs of $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (Fig. 5 a) with element mapping reveal the existence and homogeneous distributions of O (Fig. 5b), Si (Fig. 5c), Ce (Fig. 5d), and Yb (Fig. 5e) in a single Yb-doped composite particle. Furthermore, the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{Yb}$ overlap (Fig. 5f) shows that the distribution of Si is mainly located in the core region, whereas Ce and Yb are observed to be located on the outer shells, confirming the successful construction of welldefined core/shell structures for $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ composites. The elemental content data of $\mathrm{Ce}, \mathrm{Yb}, \mathrm{Si}, \mathrm{O}$, etc. (Fig. 5 g ) show an approximate atom ratio of Ce to Yb is 6.66: 1 , hence the $\mathrm{Yb} /(\mathrm{Ce}+\mathrm{Yb})$ atomic
ratio is ca. 0.131 in the $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ samples.
XRD patterns were conducted to characterize the crystal structures of the pure, La- and Yb-doped $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ samples. As shown in Fig. 6, the typical XRD diffraction peaks at ca. $28.6^{\circ}, 47.5^{\circ}, 56.3^{\circ}$, and $77.4^{\circ}$ can be ascribed to the (111), (220), (311), and (331) facts of Pm3m face-centered-cubic $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ structure (JCPDS No. 43-1002). No other peaks of $\mathrm{La}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ or $\mathrm{Yb}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ can be found in the XRD patterns, which confirms that $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ ions are successfully doped into $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystal lattices. In addition, the (111) plane diffractions of La- and Yb-doped samples slightly shift to lower diffracting angles, also revealing an expansion in the unit cell. These XRD results infer the doped species are highly dispersed in lattice site positions, indicating the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{O}$ or $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{O}$ solid solutions. The lattice parameters of pure, Laand Yb -doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanocrystals were determined to be $5.405,5.452$, and $5.439 \AA$, respectively. The lattice parameters slightly increase with an increased ionic radius of the dopant, which are in well agreement with the previous experimental results [35-38]. The ionic radii of $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ $(1.16 \AA$ ) [39] and $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}(0.99 \AA$ ) [39] cations are slightly larger than that of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}(0.97 \AA$ ) [39], therefore the partial substitution of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ by $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ or $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ cations will cause an expansion of the cubic $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattices. Based on the Debye-Scherrer equation, the average crystallite sizes of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$,

La- $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ were also calculated to be ca. $3.09,2.60$, and 2.61 nm , respectively.

Fig. 7 shows the Raman spectra of pure, La- and Yb-doped composite samples recorded under ambient conditions with an excitation wavelength of 532 nm of the laser. One intense band at ca. $460 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ and a weak band at ca. $600 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ can be clearly observed. The high-intensity bands can be attributed to the Raman-active vibrational mode $\left(\mathrm{F}_{2 \mathrm{~g}}\right)$ of fluorite-type structure, corresponding to the symmetrical stretching vibration of the oxygen atoms around cerium ions in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ units [37,38,40]. No signals related to $\mathrm{La}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ or $\mathrm{Yb}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ can be found in the Raman spectra of the doped samples, which are consistent with the XRD results (Fig. 6). For the doped samples, the slight shifting of $\mathrm{F}_{2 \mathrm{~g}}$ peaks
over lower frequency bands also suggests the incorporation of $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ or $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ ions into $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattices and the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{O}$ or $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{O}$ solid solutions. In addition, the weak Raman bands ranged from 510 to $680 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ can include the contributions of lattice VOs and reduced $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ cations. Therein, the signal centered at ca. $560 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ can be ascribed to the extrinsic VOs produced to maintain the charge neutrality after substituting $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ions $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ or $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ ions. The band located at ca. 600 $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ can be assigned to the intrinsic VOs originated from the presence of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces. As proposed by Luo and coworkers [41,42], the former can be attributed to the different oxidation state of the dopant compared to that of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, while the latter can be due to the different ionic radius of the dopant compared to that of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$. The VO

and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentrations can be also evaluated by the intensity ratio of ca. $600 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ band to ca. $460 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ peak. As expected, intensity ratio data of La-doped ( 0.21 ) and Yb -doped samples ( 0.17 ) are higher than that of pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(0.14)$, suggesting the enrichments of VOs and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions in $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ composites. Consequently, the partial substitution will contribute to the generation of structure defects due to charge compensation and lattice distortion in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials [33]. It is commonly recognized that $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration can be correlated to the VOs at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces, which are created when $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ions are transformed to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions, thus leading to the formation of VOs [36], [43]. The produced $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces can be expected to enhance the tribochemical and photochemical activities of the proposed $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive systems in CMP and PCMP processes.

The oxidation state of the elements and surface composition of the pure, La- and Yb -doped $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ samples were further investigated by XPS technique. Fig. 8 presents the wide survey XPS spectra, highresolution Ce 3d core level spectra and the corresponding peak fitting results. The XPS Ce 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 doublet peaks are usually denoted as u and v , respectively. The Ce 3d spectra can be deconvoluted into five pairs of the spin-orbital doublets (3d5/2 and 3d3/2): $\mathrm{v}_{0} / \mathrm{u}_{0} ; \mathrm{v} / \mathrm{u} ; \mathrm{v} / \mathrm{u} ;$ $\mathrm{v}^{\prime \prime} / \mathrm{u}^{\prime \prime} ; \mathrm{v}^{\prime \prime} / \mathrm{u}^{\prime \prime}[44], [45]$. Herein, $\mathrm{v}_{0} / \mathrm{u}_{0}$ and $\mathrm{v}^{\prime} / \mathrm{u}^{\prime}$ correspond to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+} 3$ d final
states, and $\mathrm{v} / \mathrm{u}, \mathrm{v}^{\prime} / \mathrm{u}^{\prime}$, and $\mathrm{v}^{\prime \prime} / \mathrm{u}^{\prime \prime}$ refer to $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+} 3$ d final states. The amount of surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ species can be semiquantitatively evaluated using the following equations (2)-(4):
$A\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}\right)=A_{s}+A_{v^{-}}+A_{v^{\prime 2}}+A_{u}+A_{u^{\prime}}+A_{u^{\prime \prime}}(2)$
$A\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right)=A_{v 0}+A_{u 0}+A_{v^{\prime}}+A_{u^{\prime}}(3)$
$\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}(\%)=\frac{A\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right)}{A\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right)+A\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}\right)}$
where $A$ is the integrated area corresponding to peak $v$ or $u$. The concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ for the pure $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ were determined to be $37.45 \%, 40.58 \%$, and $44.02 \%$, respectively. The substitution of $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ or $\mathrm{Yb}^{8+}$ ions with $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ions contribute to the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ species, which also increases the VO concentration of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based materials due to a charge compensation mechanism [36], [43]. The XPS data are consistent with the Raman results (Fig. 7).

### 3.2. Polishing performance evaluations

Compared to available light or electron microscopes, AFM is the most versatile and powerful analytical technique operated in different modes (contact, tapping, etc.) and environments (air, solution, etc.) to microscopically characterize the topography with extremely high spatial resolution and accuracy (up to Angstrom scale). In this work, the surface characteristics and planarization performances of commercial $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, non-porous $\mathrm{sSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive particles were compared in terms of high-resolution AFM.

The surface morphologies of the fused silica substrates after CMP and/or PCMP with different abrasive types are compared in Fig. 9 with an AFM scale bar of $\pm 0.2 \mathrm{~nm}$. After pre-CMP (rough polishing stage) with commercial $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives, distinct rolling and/or sliding microscratches (Fig. 9a) were left on the substrate surface from mechanical friction and abrasion. And the maximum scratch depth was determined to be -5 nm in terms of cross-section analyses. In addition, many residual abrasive particles (bright spots) can be clearly observed from the presented AFM height image. It is commonly recognized that the residual products can be responsible for an enlarged surface roughness ( $3.38 \AA$ of $R_{\mathrm{a}}, 5.55 \AA$ of $R_{\mathrm{q}}, 6.65 \AA$ of $R_{\mathrm{s}}$ ). Fig. 9 b shows an improved surface quality of the quartz glass after CMP with non-porous $\mathrm{sSiO}_{2} /$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles, although there are still some shallow scratches on the finished surface. And the average $R_{\mathrm{a}}, R_{\mathrm{q}}$, and $R_{\mathrm{s}}$ roughness decreased to $2.72 \AA, 3.92 \AA$, and $3.51 \AA$, respectively. In this work, the developed $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (Fig. 9c and d) and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (Fig. 9e and f) abrasives offered ultra-smooth and scratch-free surfaces with angstromlevel accuracy under both conventional CMP and ultraviolet irradiationassisted PCMP conditions. The detailed roughness and SAD data are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. As shown, the $R_{\mathrm{a}}, R_{\mathrm{q}}$, and $R_{\mathrm{s}}$ roughness achieved by La- and Yb-doped composite particles are much lower than those of commercial $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and rigid $\mathrm{sSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives.

The maximum asperity height, the maximum valley depth, and PV data were determined by sectional line scan analyses along the white dotted lines in 2D-AFM images (Lines 1-6). By comparison with the prefinished surface (Fig. 10a) and the surface after CMP with $\mathrm{sSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (Fig. 10b), the proposed $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (Fig. 10c and d) and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (Fig. 10e and f) achieved obviously reduced PV values and topographical variation levels. The corresponding oblique and lateral AFM views of the surfaces before and after polishing are also presented in Fig. 11. As verified by these topography results, the La- and Yb-doped composite abrasive systems contribute to producing atomically smooth quartz glass surfaces, thus achieving superior polishing performance in virtue of appropriate synergy of mechanical function and chemical function.

In order to evaluate the structural stability of the as-prepared abrasives, the $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives in the used

polishing slurries were examined by TEM observations. As shown in Fig. 12, no obvious changes in particle morphology and structure can be observed by comparison with the abrasives prior to use (Fig. 4), indicating that the developed abrasives present a satisfactory core-shell mechanical stability under an applied pressure and friction in the CMP processes. In addition, the quartz glass samples after polishing with $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives were examined by SEM observations. As expected, the polished sample presents a smooth mirror appearance, and the surface defects (residues, scratches, pits, cracks, etc.) can be hardly
found from Fig. 13.
During polishing with the $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$-involved abrasives, the quartz glass surface interacted with the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanocrystals surrounding the lowmodulus $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ spheres. Importantly, the larger $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ inner cores could act as an elastic carrier for the deposited $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and brings them in contact with the workpieces more gently and efficiently [16-21,26-28,46,47]. The presented data clearly demonstrate that $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ spheres as soft cores effect for the friction to substrates. The nonrigid $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles might elastically

deform under an applied down force, thus increasing the true contact area and decreasing the contact stress between abrasive particle and substrate surface [47]. Consequently, the non-rigid $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives offer damage-free and scratch-free surfaces by soft polishing/abrasion.

The zeta potential is a crucial factor for the dispersion stability of abrasive particles in polishing slurries. The larger absolute value of zeta potential commonly suggests that the particle dispersion is more stable in suspensions, resulting from the well-known electrostatic repulsion mechanism [18,48,49]. In this work, the Zeta potential values of the $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ slurries were determined to be $-38.2 \mathrm{mV}$ and $-43.0 \mathrm{mV}$, respectively. As confirmed by Kelvin probe force microscopy, Kim and coworkers [50] proposed that the formation of VOs and the reduction of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ increased the electron density of the trivalent lanthanide doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles, thereby increasing the Fermi level of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. Moreover, the particles can be regarded as strongly cationic or anionic when the absolute value of the zeta potential is more than 30 mV [49]. As a consequence, the negatively charged $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(-38.2 \mathrm{mV})$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(-43.0 \mathrm{mV})$ particles exhibited an acceptable dispersion stability in polishing slurries, which also contributed to the improved surface quality.

The removal efficiency data of commercial $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives, La- and Yb-doped composites toward fused silica materials are provided in Fig. 14. The $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives involved
slurries offer significant RRs increasements in comparison with the original $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based slurry. In addition, the introduction of ultraviolet irradiation during PCMP processes contributes to further $R R$ enhancements. Compared to conventional $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives, the overall RRs (CMP) of the $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ are increased by $175 \%-335$ $\%$, from ca. $23.5 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ to ca. $64.6-102.2 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$. The RRs (PCMP) of the La- and Yb-doped composites are further enhanced by $54 \%-89 \%$ (ca. $121.8-157.4 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ).

The material removal process in CMP is based on chemical wear, i.e., a wear process dominated by chemical reaction, rather than abrasive wear. For glass polishing with $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, it is commonly recognized that the multiple-step removal process involves chemical corrosion modification and tribochemical solid-sate reaction (typically "chemical tooth" mechanism proposed by Cook [51]). Regarding to this model, water molecules enter the silica glass and break the composed $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}$ bonds, thereby giving $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH}$ ( $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}$ bonds fully hydrated $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ [52-55]. Consequently, water plays an extremely crucial role in weakening and softening $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}$ bonds. This process can be further accelerated by compressive stress imposed into the surface by the abrasive particles [52]. It was further proposed that the presence of aqueous $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ contributed to enhancing the hydroxylation degree of quartz surfaces and improving the formation of $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH}$ bonds. As revealed by nanoindentation tests [55], the hardness and elasticity modulus of quartz glass ( 6.58 GPa and 68.06 GPa ) modified by $5 \% \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ solution decreased by $12.7 \%$ and $17.6 \%$ by comparison with the original workpiece ( 7.54 GPa and 82.55 GPa ). When $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles contacted with quartz glass surfaces, the hydroxyl groups at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces reacted with silanol groups at modified quartz surfaces, thus forming $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})$ -$\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds with the assistance of water molecules [51,54]. The bonding between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ enhanced the shearing force of particle abrasives, hence increasing the probability of material removal within a given indentation volume. Consequently, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ can enhance the material removal over $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ by tribochemically reacting and bonding with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$.

For $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ semiconductor materials, when the energy of ultraviolet irradiation exceeds or equals to the band gap of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, the electrons can be excited from the $\mathrm{O}_{2 p}$ valence band (VB) to an empty $\mathrm{Ce}_{4 f}$ conduction band (CB), and the holes generate in the VB, thus forming electron-hole pairs [56,57]. The photogenerated electrons are localized on cerium ions, whereas holes are trapped on oxygen ions. The holes can react with $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$or $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ forming hydroxyl radicals $\left(\bullet \mathrm{OH}\right)$. The photogenerated electrons can also interact with surrounding $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ (electron acceptors) to generate superoxide radicals $\left(\bullet \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}\right)$and $\bullet \mathrm{OH}$ radicals. Overall, reactive oxygen species mainly resulted from an incomplete reduction reaction between light-excited electrons/holes and oxygen or water during the photocatalytic reaction process. These processes can be described as the following equations (5)-(9):
$\mathrm{CeO}_{2}+h v \rightarrow \mathrm{CeO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{e}^{-}, \mathrm{h}^{+}\right)(5)$
$\mathrm{h}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} \rightarrow \bullet \mathrm{OH}(6)$
$\mathrm{h}^{+}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \bullet \mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{H}^{+}(7)$
$\mathrm{e}^{-}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \bullet \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}(8)$
$\mathrm{e}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{OH}^{-}+\bullet \mathrm{OH}(9)$
Furthermore, the photoexcited electrons may also transfer to the anti-bonding orbital of $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}$ at the glass surfaces during ultraviolet irradiation-assisted PCMP. The charged electrons in the orbitals can be expected to extend the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}$ bonding distance [58], thus weakening the bonds and softening the fused glass surfaces.

The formation of $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ hydration layer on quartz surface highly affects the final RRs and surface quality in glass polishing [59-61]. In this work, the polishing slurries were adjusted to $\mathrm{pH} 8.0-8.5$ range. In weakly alkaline conditions, the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ materials firstly reacted with $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ in aqueous solutions, as shown in equation (10), thereby leading to the formations of $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH}$ bonds and $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ hydration layers.

$\mathrm{SiO}_{2}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{SiO}_{3}^{2-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(10)$
During ultraviolet irradiation-assisted PCMP, the photoinduced electrons can react with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ generating $\bullet \mathrm{OH}$ radicals, and the holes can also react with $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ producing $\bullet \mathrm{OH}$ radicals. As proposed by Zhang and coworkers [24], [25], the reactive oxygen species (typically $\bullet \mathrm{OH}$ radicals) can be expected to accelerate the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bond breaking and the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH}$ bond creating as well as the $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ production formation. Nevertheless, the chemical reactions involved in the free radicalsassisted $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surface modification should be further investigated in terms of in situ XPS, in situ Raman, in situ Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscope, electron spin resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance, free radicals trapping, etc.

Consequently, the PCMP slurries exhibit stronger oxidation activity than CMP slurries, thus allowing an enhanced removal rate toward fused silica materials. It is commonly accepted that the enhanced separation efficiency of photogenerated electrons and holes ultimately leads to higher photocatalytic activity. For $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based photocatalysts, the separation of electron-hole pairs is highly related to the amount of surface defects (typically VOs). The surface defects can act as charge carrier traps and adsorption sites where the charge transfer to adsorbed species, thus preventing the electron-hole recombination. In this work, the number of VO increases after introducing trivalent $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ ions with relatively low doping levels ( $\sim 15 \%$ ) in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattices (as confirmed

by Raman). The appropriate doping level and VO defect amount can be responsible for the photocatalytic activity improvement. It thereby contributes to the production efficiency of reactive oxygen species $(\bullet \mathrm{OH}$,
$\bullet \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$, etc.), and further accelerates the formation and removal of $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ layer [9,24,25,62-64].

$\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive surfaces, rather than $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ species, can be expected to be reactive sites and accelerate the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ chemical bonds, thus enhancing the material removal toward $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$. It may be resulted from the enhanced adsorption affinity with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surfaces and

the generated hydroxyl groups generated at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces by dissociation reaction of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ on $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$-involved defects. As confirmed by XPS, the $\mathrm{Yb}-$ and La-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ are rich in $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ at the surfaces ( $40.58 \%$ and $44.02 \%$ ) by comparison with the pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(37.45 \%)$, while the enhanced chemical tooth property is favorable for the greater removal rates. It is also revealed that the concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions is significantly involved in the $R R$ improvement without deterioration of the surface quality for the developed abrasives. Compared to commercial $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives, the proposed La- and Yb -doped $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive systems can achieve high removal rates while maintaining high-quality fused silica surfaces in both CMP and PCMP experiments.

## 4. Conclusions

In summary, we have successfully synthesized monodispersed Laand Yb -doped $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ composite particles as novel abrasive systems for improved polishing performance. The core/shell structures of the resulting products were verified by FESEM, HRTEM, and STEM-EDX

elemental mapping. Incorporation of slightly larger $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ or $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ ions in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattices do not influence the structural nature, but increase the lattice parameter of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, as identified by XRD. Raman and XPS results revealed that more oxygen vacancies and $\mathrm{Ce}^{++}$species were created in La- and Yb-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanocrystals compared with those of pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, thus leading to the improvements of photochemical and tribochemical activities. Polishing results confirmed that the $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} / \mathrm{Yb}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive systems allowed soft polishing/abrasion and enabled high-quality surfaces without dishing, scratch, erosion, and residue defects, while maintaining high removal rates over quartz glasses. In addition, ultraviolet irradiation and soft abrasive polishing were simultaneously conducted as a result high-quality and highefficiency PCMP was achieved. The presented data clearly demonstrate that a suitable design and precise control of the configuration and composition of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based abrasive systems can be an efficient way to achieve both further high removal rate and high surface quality during ultraviolet irradiation-assisted PCMP. Further work will be focused on the cooperative roles of chemical (or photochemical) and tribochemical reactions, as well as mechanical friction in ultra-precise polishing assisted by reactive oxygen species.
