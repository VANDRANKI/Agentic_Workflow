#### Abstract

With the linewidth of integrated circuits has progressively narrowed, imposing higher demands on the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process. Cerium oxide nanoparticles are widely used as abrasives in CMP, with their physical structure and the surface content of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions and oxygen vacancies directly affecting their CMP performance. Here in, we synthesized $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ with the porous self-assembled spherical structures. Doping with $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ reduced the grain size of cerium oxide, increased its specific surface area, decreased the pore size, and increased the pore volume. HR-TEM analysis shows that the porous self-assembled spherical $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ primarily exposes the (111) crystal facet. Additionally, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation, XPS, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ TPR and XANES analyses shown that doping of $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ facilitated the formation of oxygen vacancies and increased the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content on the (111) crystal facet of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. La atoms are more likely to stabilize on the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (111) surface compared to Pr and Nd atoms. The CMP results indicated that, The $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ exhibited a higher MRR of $338 \pm 7.54 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$, which is a $35 \%$ increase compared to $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, and achieved superior surface roughness $\left(R a=0.201 \pm 0.010 \mathrm{~nm}\right)$.


## 1. Introduction

Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) technology is indispensable for achieving local and global planarization of semiconductor devices. It is widely utilized in polishing both optical glass and integrated circuit [1-3]. As electronic devices become increasingly integrated, the demand for the surface flatness of silicon wafers is escalating. Consequently, the importance of CMP technology is growing steadily[4]. $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is regarded as one of the most promising CMP abrasives when compared to traditional $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}[5]$. This is due to its unique 4 f electronic structure, as well as the coexistence of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ in the crystal lattice, and the presence of inherent oxygen vacancies[6].

Due to the synergistic effect of mechanical friction and chemical reactions, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives can achieve a high material removal rate
(MRR) and high surface flatness[7]. The "Chemical Tooth" theory, originally formulated by Cook, is the mainstream theory underlying the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ polishing process[8]. Under the combined mechanical and chemical actions, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions on the surface of cerium oxide react with the Si-O-Si or Si-OH bonds on the surface of silicon dioxide, forming Ce -O-Si bonds. the formation and breaking of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive particles and the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film is crucial for achieving the high removal rate of cerium oxide[9,10]. Tasuku et al[11]. using firstprinciples molecular dynamics study, discovered that during the polishing process, the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds leads to the transformation of surface Si atoms in $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ into pentacoordinate Si atoms. Simultaneously, $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions donate electrons to the antibonding orbitals of the Si-O bond, thereby effectively weakening or breaking the Si-O-Si bond within the pentacoordinate Si atom. Consequently, the presence of

oxygen vacancies and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content on the cerium oxide surface are the principal factors influencing its chemical performance during the CMP process.

Moreover, the size, morphology, and structure of cerium oxide as a polishing material have an influence its chemical activities and mechanical properties[12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Core-shell structures have been introduced into CMP due to their circular surface morphology, narrow size distribution, and low elastic modulus, resulting in effective reduction of scratch defects[17], [18]. However, these structures generally exhibit low MRR and are susceptible to structural and functional failure under pressure, thus limiting their widespread application[19]. Notably, in recent years, porous spherical self-assembled cerium oxide has garnered significant attention in fields such as magnetics and catalysis due to its unique multilayered assembly structure[20], [21]. In the field of CMP, Chen et al[22], [23]. synthesized a series of dendritic mesoporous silica $\left(\mathrm{DmSiO}_{2}\right)$ supported samarium (Sm)-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanocrystals through a simple chemical precipitation method. The resulting powders exhibited a low elastic modulus, enabling a lower surface roughness ; Kim et al [24]. found that spherical $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ assembled from nanoparticles possesses both physically soft and chemically active ( $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions) properties. The spherical structure, assembled from primary particles of smaller size, possesses a higher specific surface area and a greater surface concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ compared to single-crystal cerium oxide. Moreover, the mesopores resulting from the assembled structure contribute to a decreased elastic modulus. This results in a larger contact area with the workpiece during polishing compared to conventional single-crystal spherical cerium oxide, as well as exerting less pressure on the surface of the workpiece [16]. Consequently, it enhances the MRR while minimizing the generation of excessive scratches [25]. Furthermore, unlike core-shell structures, this structures maintains its integrity after polishing, significantly enhancing its reusability and promoting resource conservation [26]. It has been observed that in the extant literature, these spherical cerium oxide structures assembled from primary particles mainly expose the (111) crystal facet [26], [27]. It is well-recognized that the cerium oxide (111) surface has the lowest concentration of surface oxygen vacancies among the major crystal facets (111/110/ 100), which could potentially constrain its chemical activity ( $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions) and become a primary limiting factor enhancements of its CMP performance [28].

The enhancement of the surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy content of cerium oxide is mainly achieved through doping with rare earth elements and transition metals, adjusting the atmosphere conditions during oxidation, and synthesizing novel structures [29], [30], [31]. Recent studies have shown significant interest in increasing the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ through doping aimed at enhancing the interfacial chemical reaction with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ [32], [33], [34]. Trivalent dopants, particularly those from rare earth elements, have the ability to substitute for $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, leading to the release of additional oxygen vacancies and facilitating the reduction of neighboring $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ions to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}[35], [36]$. Cheng et al [37]. enhanced the MRR of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives by modifying the surface of commercial particles through ion doping. Kim et al [36]. synthesized $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ doped nano-cerium dioxide directly using the conventional hydrothermal method and confirmed its significant effect on improving the CMP performance of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$. Preliminary studies using Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicate that doping ceramic materials with rare earth elements such as $\mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Pr}$, and Nd tends to localize on the surface, decrease the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, and enhance their surface chemical activity [38].

Inspired by the considerations mentioned above, we propose a novel strategy building on the synthesis of porous spherical self-assembled cerium oxide, to enhance the surface concentrations of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancies by doping with $\mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Pr}$, and Nd. This strategy is expected to reduce the grain size, increase the specific surface area and pore volume, and improve the chemical and mechanical properties of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives during the CMP process. The synthesized materials were characterized by techniques such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). The results showed that the synthesized self-assembled porous spherical cerium oxide primarily exposes the (111) crystal facet. Further, BET analysis showed that porous spherical self-assembled cerium oxide has a reduction in pore size and an increase in pore volume, as well as enhanced concentrations of surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions and oxygen vacancies. $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-TPR demonstrated that doping cerium oxide with $\mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Pr}$, and Nd increased the concentration of oxygen vacancies, with La doping exhibiting the highest concentration. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further validated that doping with $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ reduces the formation energy for oxygen vacancies and increases oxygen vacancies on the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (111) crystal facet. The doping formation energy indicates that $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ are readily distributed on the surface of cerium oxide, with La exhibiting greater stability on the surface compared to Pr and Nd. CMP tests revealed that the doped self-assembled spherical cerium oxide had a higher MRR and improved surface flatness, with La doping showing the most superior CMP performance.

## 2. Experimental

### 2.1. Materials

Cerium chloride solution was prepared by dissolving Cerium(III) chloride heptahydrate $\left(\mathrm{CeCl}_{2} \cdot 7 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right.$, Aladdin, $\geq 99.9 \%$,) in deionized water. Sodium bicarbonate solution was prepared by dissolving sodium bicarbonate $\left(\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}\right.$, Xilong Science Co., Ltd, $\geq 99.5 \%$ ) from General Reagent in deionized water. All chemical reagents were used as received, without additional purification.

Initially, 150 mL of $0.6 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ sodium bicarbonate solution was mixed with $100 \mathrm{ml}, 0.6 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ cerium chloride solution, resulting in a white precipitate. The molar ratio of sodium bicarbonate to the cerium chloride was denoted to R, where $\mathrm{R}=3$. The precipitate was continuously stirred at a rate of 400 rpm for 5 min , then transferred to the Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave, and maintained at $180^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with continuous mixing of 300 rpm to ensure the uniform nanoparticles growth. After heating for 12 h , filter the obtained sedimentation products, wash them with deionized water and ethanol several times and dry them for 12 h at the $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Subsequently, the dried sample was heated at $900^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and cooled to room temperature over 3 h . Pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles ( $\mathrm{p}^{-}$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ ) were obtained. The synthesis method of $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles $\left(\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\right)$ followed the aforementioned procedure. In this study, lanthanide chloride salts were added to the cerium chloride solution. Lanthanum chloride heptahydrate $\left(\mathrm{LaCl}_{2} \cdot 7 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right.$, Aladdin, $\geq$ $99.9 \%$ ), neodymium chloride hexahydrate $\left(\mathrm{NdCl}_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right.$, Aladdin, $\geq$ $99.9 \%$ ), and praseodymium chloride hexahydrate $\left(\mathrm{PrCl}_{2} \cdot 7 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right.$, Aladdin, $\geq 99.9 \%$ ) were utilized as precursor salts for doping with rare earth elements. The doping concentration was 10 wt $\%$.

### 2.2. Characterizations

Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analysis was performed with a Profile Spec ICP-AES spectrometer (Leeman, U.S.A.). The phase composition of the products was characterized by powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Smart-lab, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with $\mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{K} a$ radiation. The morphologies and size of the products were analyzed using offline scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7900F, JEOL, Japan). The morphology was characterized by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Talos F200X, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The valence states of Cerium $\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+} / \mathrm{Ce}^{4+}\right)$ were characterized using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, NEXSA, Thermo Scientific, USA) with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS, Link ISIS, Oxford, UK). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area, pore volume and size were tested by (ASAP 2460, Micromeritics, USA). Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction ( $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-TPR) was performed by TP-5080B, Raman spectroscopy analyses were performed on a Raman

spectroscope (ThermoFisher, Dxr2xi, UK) with an excitation laser wavelength of 532 nm in the range of $200-1200 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurements were carried out at the Xray adsorption spectra (XAFS) station (BL14W1) in the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), China.[16]. The surface elastic modulus of the porous $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles was directly tested by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Cypher S/Oxford Instruments Asylum Research) using the mode of AM-FM. Force spectroscopy tests were performed on the AFM (Cypher S/Oxford Instruments Asylum Research). The probe tip is silicon with a force constant with the set point of 800 mV (in the form of potential) and is very sharp with a curvature radius of about 2 nm , which can detect nanoscale heterogeneity.

### 2.3. DFT calculations

The first-principles calculation based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT) was conducted using the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) code[39]. The electronic wave functions were described using the Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method. the cutoff energy of the plane wave basis was set to $450 \mathrm{eV}[40]$. the KohnSham equations were solved with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), and the exchange correlation functional of Perdew-BurkeErnzerhof (PBE) Effective Hubbard parameters (U) was employed to explain the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion between localized 4f orbitals of lanthanide elements[38]. In this study, U=5 eV was applied to the 4 f orbitals of Ce and dopants, while $\mathrm{U}=4.5 \mathrm{eV}$ is applied to the 4 f orbitals of $\operatorname{Pr}$ [41]. In this study, we investigated the impact of $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ doping on the oxygen vacancies of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (111) surface. A $3 \times 3 \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (111) slab model was constructed, and $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ doping was implemented by replacing Ce atoms to simulate $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (111). Subsequently, one oxygen atom was removed to generate an oxygen vacancy. Self-consistent calculations were performed using a $3 \times 3 \times 1$ k-point sampling of the Brillouin zone. Structural relaxation was achieved using the Hellmann-Feynman approximation, with atomic positions relaxed until the force acting on each atom was below $0.02 \mathrm{eV} / \AA$.

### 2.4. CMP test

2 inches silicon wafer with a $2 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ thick $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film was polished using a ProLap-15 polishing machine (Shenzhen Mayor Yong precision Technology). The basic parameter of CMP is shown in Table S1. The weight of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film was measured using a precise balance (Mettler Toledo, CH ) to calculate the MRR according to Eq. (1)

Here, $\Delta m(\mathrm{~g})$ represents the mass change of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film before and after polishing, where $M(\mathrm{~g})$ denotes the mass of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film before polishing, $H$ $(\mathrm{mm})$ signifies the thickness of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film before polishing, $t(\mathrm{~min})$ indicates the polishing time, and MRR denotes the material removal rate of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film. The MRR were calculated from three runs.
$\operatorname{MRR}=\frac{10^{6} \times \Delta \mathrm{m} \times H}{M \times t}$
The high-resolution surface morphologies of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film before and after polishing were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM, Dimension Icon, Bruker) with a scanning range of $5 \times 5 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ (512 pixels per line) in tapping mode. The recorded data were processed using the software (NanoScope Analysis) to determine the three-dimensional (3D) images and the average roughness (Ra). The presented data (average surface roughness and its standard deviation) were calculated from three runs.

Polishing slurries were prepared with the $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{c}-$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (Dalian Guomao Material Technology Co., Ltd) composite abrasives at a concentration of $1.0 \mathrm{wt} \%$ in deionized water. These slurries were then modified through pH adjustment 6.0 and surfactant (PVP, 0.5 $\mathrm{wt} \%$ ). The dispersant aimed to enhance the dispensability of the abrasives in polishing slurries. The Zeta potential of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ slurry was measured by a laser zeta potential analyzer (90Plus PALS, Brookhaven,
USA).

## 3. Result and discussion

### 3.1. Morphology and structure characterization of the $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$

The content of the dopant elements $(\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd})$ in the $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ was analyzed using ICP. The content of $\mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Pr}$, and Nd after doping is shown in Table S2, at approximately $10 \%$. Consistent with the doping levels designed in the experiment. Fig. 1(a, b) displays the XRD pattern of the pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\right)$ and $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, demonstrating a typical cubic fluorite structure without phase separation, which aligns well with the PDF\#34-0394. The diffraction peak intensities of the (111) and (220) crystal facet of $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ have decreased to varying degrees and shifted due to lattice distortion induced by the introduction of $\mathrm{La} /$ $\mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$. According to the Debye-Scherrer equation, the grain size can be calculated based on the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and Bragg angle of the (111) and (220) diffraction peaks [42]. Furthermore, lattice parameters can be calculated using the Bragg equation[43].The calculated grain sizes and lattice parameters are presented in Table 1. Following doping, the grain size of $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(21.4 \mathrm{~nm}), \mathrm{Pr}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(26.1$ nm ), and $\mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(24.2 \mathrm{~nm})$ has decreased to varying degrees compared to $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(30.1 \mathrm{~nm})$, likely due to dopant-induced lattice distortion, which hinders grain growth. Due to the larger ionic radii of $\mathrm{La}^{3+}(1.06 \AA), \mathrm{Pr}^{3+}(1.01 \AA)$, and $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}(0.99 \AA)$ compared to $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}(0.92$ $\AA$ ), the lattice constant of $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(5.4395 \AA), \mathrm{Pr}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(5.4185 \AA)$, and $\mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(5.4331 \AA)$ have increased compared to $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(5.4112 \AA)$. The variation in lattice constant after Pr doping is minor, possibly due to the oxidation $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ to $\mathrm{Pr}^{4+}$ during calcination, where the radius of $\mathrm{Pr}^{4+}$ $(0.90 \AA)$ is slightly smaller than that of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$. Additionally, when trivalent ions $\left(\mathrm{La}^{3+} / \mathrm{Pr}^{3+} / \mathrm{Nd}^{4+}\right)$ replace $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ions, oxygen vacancies are generated to neutralize the charge, and two adjacent $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ions will transform into $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, with a radius of $1.03 \AA$. This also induces significant lattice distortion, hindering crystal growth. Self-assembled spherical cerium oxide is constructed from primary particles. Doping reduces the size of these grains, which in turn affects the specific surface area of the assembled cerium oxide. The porous structures of the samples were revealed by $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ adsorption/desorption measurements (Fig. 1 c-d), Specific surface area measurements indicate that doping with $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ ( $\mathrm{La}-$ $59.14 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}, \mathrm{Pr}-38.25 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}, \mathrm{Nd}-53.02 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ ) resulted in an increase in surface area compared to the undoped value of $28.09 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$. Among these, $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ exhibited the highest specific surface area, primarily due to lattice distortions caused by La doping, which impeded the growth of the grain size of cerium oxide, providing a larger surface area for the assembled cerium oxide. At the end of the hydrothermal preparation, the precipitate forms self-assembled spherical cerium carbonate. During the thermal decomposition of the cerium carbonate into $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, the generated $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ leads to the formation of mesopores on the surface and within the $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. Pore size and pore volume measurements indicated reductions in pore size post-doped with $\mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Pr}$, and $\mathrm{Nd}(\mathrm{La}-4.49 \mathrm{~nm}, \mathrm{Pr}-$ $11.82 \mathrm{~nm}, \mathrm{Nd}-5.65 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) compared to undoped ( 14.23 nm ), while pore volumes increased $\left(\mathrm{La}-0.115 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \mathrm{g}, \mathrm{Pr}-0.094 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \mathrm{g}, \mathrm{Nd}-0.105 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \mathrm{g}\right)$ from the undoped value $\left(0.079 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \mathrm{g}\right)$. The reduction in grain size after doping resulted in decreased pore size, requiring more primary crystallites for assembly when particle sizes are similar, which increased the number of mesopores between the grains and thus led to an increase in pore volume.

SEM images of cerium oxide before and after doping are depicted in Fig. 2(a-h). Both before and after doping, the Cerium oxide particles retain a spherical morphology, are assembled from nanoparticles, possess numerous mesopores, and are evenly dispersed. The doping of elements did not significantly alter the morphology of the particles. In Fig. 2(i-l), particle size analysis was conducted, revealing that the average particle size of the doped, self-assembled cerium oxide particles remained approximately 200 nm .

with $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ displaying a spherical self-assembled structure and an interplanar spacing of 0.311 nm , corresponding to the (111) crystal facet of cerium oxide. Fig. 3(c-h) show the EDS mapping and HR-TEM images of doped cerium oxide particle. The morphology of the doped particles remains spherical, but with a smaller grain size and a denser assembled structure, leading to reduced pore size while noticeably increasing the pore volume. Post-doping, $\mathrm{Ce}, \mathrm{O}$, and $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ are uniformly distributed on the spheres. With the incorporation of $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$, the interplanar spacing increases ( $\mathrm{La}-0.331 \mathrm{~nm}, \mathrm{Pr}-0.322 \mathrm{~nm}, \mathrm{Nd}-0.325 \mathrm{~nm}$ ). Fig. 3(b) illustrates the $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ doped- $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particle schematically, showing the surface distribution of mesopores. The porous structure results in a reduced modulus of elasticity for the particles. Fig. S1 exhibits the elastic modulus mapping of the $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ by AM-FM[44]. The average elastic modulus of $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is 126.45 GPa , and exhibits homogeneous distribution of the elastic modulus. Lower than the elastic modulus reported for $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\left(264 \mathrm{GPa}\right.$, Nanoindentation technique; 174 GPa, Small Punch) in literature[45]. This could lead to the particles exhibiting better mechanical performance during the CMP process.

3.2. Influence of $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ on oxygen vacancy and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+} / \mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ content

Fig. 4(a) depict broad-scan XPS spectrum of doped cerium oxide. The presence of dopant elements $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ within the cerium oxide powder is clearly evident, as indicated by characteristic XPS peaks. The surface composition of element oxides calculated from normalized peak areas in XPS spectra is summarized in Table S3. A comparison of the surface percentage content of $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ reveals that the surface La content ( $16.82 \%$ ) of doped cerium oxide is significantly higher than that of Pr ( $14.02 \%$ ) and Nd ( $13.56 \%$ ). Fig. 4(b) displays the Ce 3d XPS spectra of $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The Ce 3d XPS spectra are complex, with each spectrum potentially deconvoluted into ten peaks belonging to two multiples(46). Specifically, the Ce 3d peaks consist of ionizations corresponding to $\mathrm{Ce} 3 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce} 3 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}$. Among these peaks, $v_{0}, v^{\prime}, u^{\prime}$, and $u_{0}$ peaks represent the characteristics of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, while $v, v^{\prime}, v^{\prime \prime}, u, u^{\prime}$ and $u^{\prime \prime}$ peaks exhibit the $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ [47]. The characteristic peaks of each sample are summarized in Table S4 for reference. The surface concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ was determined by the following Eq. (2)-(4). where C and A represent concentration and area, respectively. Therefore, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content is calculated as the ratio of the area of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ to the sum of the areas of both $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ peaks. As shown in Table S5, after doping, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content significantly increases. Compared to the surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content of $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(26.4 \%)$, the surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content of $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(37.3 \%)$, $\mathrm{Pr}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ ( $33.4 \%$ ), and $\mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(32.2 \%)$ has increased. Fig. 4(c) shows highresolution O 1 s spectra of both $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The peak

at 529.3 eV corresponds to lattice oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{a}\right)$, while the peak at 531.3 eV corresponds to surface oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{b}\right)$. The peak at 532.2 eV is attributed to $\mathrm{OH}^{-}\left(\mathrm{O}_{s}\right)$ [48]. The calculation method for oxygen vacancy content (OVs) is described in Eq. (5). After doping, the oxygen vacancy content significantly increases. Compared to the surface oxygen vacancy content of $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(10.2 \%)$, the surface oxygen vacancy content of $\mathrm{La}-$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(28.8 \%)$, $\mathrm{Pr}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(22.4 \%)$, and $\mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(21.1 \%)$ has increased. Table S5 provides specific information on the content of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions and oxygen vacancies on the surface of the samples.

Raman spectroscopy is the primary method for characterizing oxygen vacancies in cerium dioxide. Fig. 4(d) displays the Raman spectra of $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The strongest peak, $\mathrm{F}_{2 \mathrm{~g}}$, appears at 465 $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, attributed to the symmetric stretching of cerium oxide. This peak is highly sensitive to defects in cerium oxide [49]. The presence of doping elements $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ induce changes in the vicinity of oxygen atoms around Ce atoms in the cubic fluorite structure of cerium oxide, resulting to the formation of oxygen vacancies. Doping with $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ results in a red shift of the $\mathrm{F}_{2 \mathrm{~g}}$ peak, indicating the presence of oxygen vacancies in the bulk phase, along with the reduction of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. Within the range of $500 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ to $650 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, two minor peaks are also observed. The appearance of the $\alpha$ peak at $560 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ is indicative of oxygen vacancies, that attributed to the substitution of trivalent rare earth ions ( $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ ) into the cerium oxide lattice, and peaks near 600 $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ are indicative of oxygen vacancies[17,50,51]. La-CeO2 demonstrates the highest concentration of oxygen vacancies, followed by $\mathrm{Pr}-$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, all exceeding that of $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. This finding is
consistent with the analysis of O 1s in XPS. As shown in Fig. 4(e), we performed XANES on $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ to further determine the impact of introducing dopant elements on the cerium valence state [52-54]. It was observed that the energy of the $\mathrm{Ce} \mathrm{L}_{3}$-edge in $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is lower than that in $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ but higher than in $\mathrm{Ce}_{2}\left(\mathrm{CO}_{3}\right)_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. This indicates that the valence state of Ce lies between $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. Additionally, the $\mathrm{L}_{3}$-edge energy of Ce in $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is lower than in $\mathrm{Pr}-$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, suggesting that the cerium valence state in $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is lower than in $\mathrm{Pr}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the chemical activity of $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ in this study, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-TPR is also employed [55]. We further conducted $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-TPR analysis. As shown in Fig. 4(f), $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ samples are typically divided into three regions: Region I, Region II, and Region III. Region I and Region II correspond to temperatures between $200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $650^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, while Region III corresponds to temperatures between $650{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $900{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Previous studies suggest that Region I and Region II relate to the reduction of surface oxygen, whereas Region III pertains to the reduction of lattice oxygen in the bulk phase [56]. Specifically, Region I corresponds to the reduction of adsorbed surface oxygen, whereas Region II corresponds to the reduction of surface lattice oxygen[57]. Within Region I, $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ displays the highest adsorbed oxygen content, correlating with a higher concentration of surface oxygen vacancies. Intriguingly, the emergence of a minor peak for $\mathrm{Pr}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ at $381^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ implies the existence of potentially more active cerium oxide, which could impact the performance in subsequent polishing CMP processes. In Region II, $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ did not exhibit a signal peak, thus we deduced that the signal peak around $580{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in Region II was induced by the doping elements. $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ exhibited greater $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ consumption, potentially associated with the surface enrichment of La detected in XPS analyses. The elevated surface La content leads to more surface oxygen vacancies. Within Region III, the signal peak of $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ appears at $692{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, preceding that of $\mathrm{p}-$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\left(778{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, signifying heightened activity resulting from dopantinduced lattice distortion and the presence of oxygen vacancies in the cerium oxide bulk phase. The consumption of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ during the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$-TPR

process from $200{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $900{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is illustrated in Table S6, compared to the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ consumption of $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(719.55 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{g})$, the $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ consumption of $\mathrm{La}-$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\left(1302.44 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{g}\right), \mathrm{Pr}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(989.39 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{g})$, and $\mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ $(936.88 \mu \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{g})$ is higher, with $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ displaying the highest $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ consumption, implying potentially superior performance in CMP processes.

According to previous studies, the (111) crystal facet of cerium oxide exhibits the highest stability[58]. Furthermore, as depicted in Fig. 3, both the $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ synthesized in this study predominantly expose the (111) crystal facet. The lower formation energy of oxygen vacancies leads to a more formation of oxygen vacancies. The formation of oxygen vacancies leads to the reduction of adjacent two $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ions to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, thus facilitating the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ on the surface of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ [59]. Fig. 5(a, b) and Fig. S2 show the slab model of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (111) crystal facet and doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (111) crystal facet. The formation energy of oxygen vacancies $\left(E_{\text {vac }}\right)$ can be calculated using Eq. (6), where $E\left(\right.$ cell $_{\text {vac }}$ ) and $E($ cell $)$ denote the energies of supercells with and without oxygen vacancies, respectively, and $E\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ represents the energy of the ground state of oxygen molecules [39]. From Table 2, it can be observed that the calculated $E_{\text {vac }}$ for the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (111) surface is 2.53 eV , which is similar to other calculations $2.45 \mathrm{eV}[60]$. The formation energy of oxygen vacancies on the (111) surfaces of $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(1.38 \mathrm{eV}), \mathrm{Pr}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$
(1.90 eV ), and $\mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(2.26 \mathrm{eV})$ is lower than that of $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(2.53 \mathrm{eV})$. Fig. 6(a) illustrates the relationships between oxygen vacancy energies, and oxygen vacancy and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentrations for $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-$ doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. After doping with $\mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Pr}$, and Nd , there is a decrease in the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, and increases in the concentrations of surface oxygen vacancies and trivalent cerium. Specifically, $\mathrm{La}-$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ exhibits the lowest formation energy of oxygen vacancies, consistent with the highest oxygen vacancy and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content observed in XPS. According to previous studies, doping with rare earth atoms such as $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ tends to stabilize on the crystal surface [61]. Formation energy can serve as a characteristic parameter for predicting the thermal stability of crystal structures [38]. We calculated the formation energies for doping the (111) surface and subsurface of $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. Fig. 5(c, d) illustrates the atomic models constructed for the surface $\left(f_{1}\right)$ and subsurface $\left(f_{2}\right)$ of doped- $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The formula for calculating formation energy is given by Eq. (7). where $E_{\mathrm{M}-\mathrm{CeO} 2}$ and $E_{\mathrm{CeO} 2}$ are total energies of RE doped and stoichiometric $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (111) surface, respectively. $E_{\mathrm{Ce}}$ and $E_{\mathrm{M}}$ are the energies of single Ce atom and the selected metal atom. As shown in Fig. 6 (b), it is evident that the (111) surface formation energy with these doped- $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is significantly lower than that of the subsurface. The doping with $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ tends to concentrate on the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (111) surface. Furthermore, after La doping, the formation energy of both the

### 3.3. CMP performance evaluations

Before conducting CMP tests, cerium oxide particles are typically formulated into a polishing slurry. As shown in the Fig. S3, the Zeta potential of the slurry prepared with our porous spherical self-assembled cerium oxide ( $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2},-37 \pm 2.0 \mathrm{mV} ; \mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2},-43 \pm 1.4 \mathrm{mV} ; \mathrm{Pr}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, $-39 \pm 1.5 \mathrm{mV} ; \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2},-41 \pm 3.1 \mathrm{mV}$ ) are around -40 mV . Compared to the $\mathrm{c}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, which has a Zeta potential of $-24 \pm 4.5 \mathrm{mV}$, the higher absolute value of our slurry indicates a better ability to prevent particle agglomeration. Fig. 7 illustrates the MRR data of

homemade and c- $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The MRR of the homemade powder ( $252 \pm 6.02$ $\mathrm{nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ) surpasses that of the c- $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(160 \pm 8.18 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min})$ polishing powder. Furthermore, the MRR of $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(338 \pm 7.54 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}), \mathrm{Pr}-$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(306 \pm 4.04 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min})$, and $\mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(295 \pm 6.55 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min})$ are $20-35 \%$ higher than that of $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The physical structural changes induced by doping elements, along with the increased concentrations of surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancies, are the main factors that enhance the mechanical and chemical properties, leading to an increased MRR of $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ compared to $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. And in contrast to $\mathrm{c}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, the enhanced MRR of homemade cerium oxide can be attributed to its
porous spherical self-assembled structure and elevated $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy content.

Surface roughness (Ra) after polishing is a crucial factor in assessing the effectiveness of CMP. Fig. 8(a-f) presents the 3D surface morphology of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film before and after polishing. It can be observed that the before polished surface exhibits larger roughness, with a $R a$ of $0.939 \pm 0.015$ nm over an area of $5 \times 5 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. The Ra after polishing with $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2} / \mathrm{Pr}-$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is $0.201 \pm 0.010 / 0.231 \pm 0.012 / 0.221 \pm 0.016 \mathrm{~nm}$, lower than that achieved with $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ ( $\mathrm{Ra}=0.289 \pm 0.009 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) and $\mathrm{c}-$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(\mathrm{Ra}=0.332 \pm 0.013 \mathrm{~nm})$, resulting in a smooth 3D surface morphology. Additionally, we analyzed the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film surface before and after polishing by scanning along the dashed lines in Fig. 8(a-f) to assess the maximum asperity height, maximum valley depth, and maximum peak-to-valley distance (PV). As shown in Fig. 8(g), compared to the unpolished $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film surface and the surface polished with commercial $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film surface polished with the homemade powder exhibits a more uniform distribution of roughness peaks. Both the maximum asperity height and the maximum valley depth are reduced,

with the best results observed after polishing with $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(\mathrm{PV}=0.70$ nm ). Thus, porous self-assembled spherical cerium oxide particles doped with rare earth ions ( $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ ) demonstrate both a higher MRR and improved surface quality after polishing. Among them, $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ has the best CMP performance.

As shown in Fig. S4, the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles did not exhibit significant morphological and structural changes after CMP, indicating that the porous spherical self-assembled structure maintains strong stability under pressure and friction. Additionally, we collected the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ slurry waste after CMP and conducted morphological and elemental analyses using TEM and EDS. As indicated by the red circles in Fig. 9 (a, e), we observed particles with irregular morphology that are distinctly different from the cerium oxide particles. The elemental mapping results, as shown in Fig. 9 (b-d, f-h), indicate that the irregular particles are composed of Si and O elements, while the regions of the porous spherical assembled particles predominantly contain Ce and O elements, with a minor presence of Si. The quantitative elemental analysis results from Fig. 9 (f-h) are presented in Fig. S5 and Table S7, showing that the irregular particles consist of $13.7 \% \mathrm{Si}, 5.47 \% \mathrm{Ce}$, and $81.46 \% \mathrm{O}$ by atomic percentage. These findings suggest that the irregularly shaped
particles are likely lumped $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$. As shown in the Fig. S6, the SEM image of polished samples exhibit a smooth, mirror-like appearance with surface defects. Additionally, almost no adsorbed particles were observed on the surface.

The $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive demonstrates excellent CMP performance. Fig. 10 illustrates the polishing mechanism of cerium oxide abrasive post-doping. In terms of mechanical action, the porous spherical structure, assembled from primary particles, exhibits two primary mechanical removal behaviors during polishing: sliding and rolling. Additionally, the porous structure results in a reduced modulus of elasticity for the particles, causing slight elastic deformation when in contact with the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film surface. This deformation reduces the impact on the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film surface while increasing the contact area between the particles and the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film. This optimization in mechanical behavior can partially reduce scratches and damage[18,32]. In terms of chemical action, doping with $\mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Pr}$, and Nd increases the concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions and oxygen vacancies on the surface of cerium oxide, thereby enhancing the chemical activity of $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. Additionally, the reduction in primary particle size also leads to an increased specific surface area, which enlarges the contact area between $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film, providing more reaction sites for the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds. In the CMP process using $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ as abrasives, the key link between the structural characteristics of the abrasive and its mechanical performance is believed to be the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ chemical bond. Surface defects on $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles, particularly $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancies, facilitate the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds [62]. The removal mechanism of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ is fundamentally related to the dynamic formation and breaking of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds, which makes the CMP process more efficient and of higher quality[63]. The $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy content on the surface of $\mathrm{La} /$ $\mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ have significantly increased compared to $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. Among them, $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ has the highest content of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancies on the surface. The enriched surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancies (OVs) facilitate the chemical bonding between cerium oxide and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$, thereby enhancing the chemical reaction efficiency during the CMP process $[4,23,37]$. Therefore, the MRR of $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is superior to that of $\mathrm{p}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. Among them, $\mathrm{La}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ has the highest MRR. Based on the above discussion of the mechanisms, the doped porous spherical selfassembled cerium oxide prepared in this study demonstrates optimized mechanical behavior and enhanced chemical reactions during the CMP process. This results in a high MRR and superior surface quality.

## 4. Conclusion

To enhance the CMP performance of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives, we synthesized rare earth (RE) ions ( $\mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Pr}$ and Nd ) doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ with the porous self-assembled spherical structures. After doping with $\mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Pr}$, and Nd , the grain size of cerium oxide particles decreases, the specific surface area increases, the pore size decreases, and the pore volume increases. Moreover, doping with $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ elements promotes the formation of surface oxygen vacancies and the transition of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, this results in an increase in the content of surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. Among these, La doping showing the highest content of oxygen vacancies and surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. The surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ doped with $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$ is 37.3 $\% / 33.4 \% / 32.2 \%$, significantly higher than before doping ( $26.4 \%$ ). DFT calculations indicate that doping with $\mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Pr}$, and Nd reduces the formation energy of oxygen vacancies on the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (111) surface. Among
these, La doping results in the lowest oxygen vacancies formation energy, thereby facilitating their formation of oxygen vacancies. The formation energies on both the surface and subsurface of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (111) indicate that doping with $\mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Pr}$, and Nd stabilizes easily on the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (111) surface, with La showing higher stability and a greater tendency to be distributed on the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (111) surface, these observations are consistent with XPS results. Compared to p- $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(R a=0.289 \pm 0.009$ $\mathrm{nm}, \mathrm{MRR}=252 \pm 6.02 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ), the MRR and surface precision of $\mathrm{La} /$ $\mathrm{Pr} / \mathrm{Nd}$-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ have improved ( $R a=0.201 \pm 0.010 / 0.231 \pm$ $0.012 / 0.221 \pm 0.016 \mathrm{~nm}, \mathrm{MRR}=338 \pm 7.54 / 306 \pm 4.04 / 295 \pm 6.55$ $\mathrm{nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ). Owing to its higher MRR and excellent surface quality of this doped- $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive, it is believed that the rare earth element-doped porous spherical self-assembled cerium oxide developed in this study will achieve large-scale application in STI polishing of advanced process integrated circuits.
