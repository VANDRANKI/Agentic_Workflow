#### Abstract

Development of novel abrasive systems with functional activities and physicochemical properties are of great significance in the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-enhanced chemical mechanical polishing. In this work, Ce single-doped and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}$ co-doped dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs), namely $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$, were produced via a simple impregnation and thermolysis procedure. The Ce and/or Cu species involved in DMSNs frameworks were characterized through X-ray diffractometry, infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectrometry, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and nitrogen adsorption/desorption techniques. We report the evolution of surface morphology and roughness, defects, peak-to-valley data, image surface area difference, and material removal efficiency during ROS-enhanced polishing experiments toward silica materials. All the pure, Ce single-doped, and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}$ co-doped DMSNs abrasive systems offered nearly defect-free surfaces with close-to-atom scale roughness. It might be attributed to the "springlike effect" and "soft polishing/abrasion", possibly originating from the lowmodulus DMSNs carriers. Among these abrasives, the $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}$ co-doped DMSNs systems achieved an evident improvement in removal efficiency, especially under ultraviolet irradiation-assisted polishing conditions. The coexisted $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III}) / \mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{IV})$ and $\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{I}) / \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{II})$ couples might be responsible for the effective production of ROS in photocatalysis and Fenton-like processes, thereby contributing to the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonding formations. The role of the developed $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}$ co-doped DMSNs abrasive systems in ROS-enhanced polishing processes was discussed.


## 1. Introduction

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) [1,2] have emerged as powerful techniques tackling water, air, and soil pollution by the production and utilization of highly reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydroxyl radicals $\left(\bullet \mathrm{OH}\right)$, sulfate radicals $\left(\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}\right)$, superoxide anion radicals $\left(\bullet \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}\right)$, etc. These ROS can cause the chemical bond breakage of recalcitrant organic compounds through the reactions such as electron transfer, hydrogen bonding addition, or substitution, ultimately oxidizing C and H into $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Among these ROS, $\bullet \mathrm{OH}$ radicals can be regarded as one of the most powerful oxidants $\left(\mathrm{E}^{\mathrm{0}}=2.80 \mathrm{~V}\right)$ [1]. There are several reacting systems involved in ROS productions,
including photochemical and electrochemical oxidation, Fenton-related reactions, activated persulfate systems, ozone-involved systems, wet oxidation processes, ultraviolet (UV) or ultrasound or plasma treatments, etc. For example, the Fenton reaction [3,4] is an effective ROS generation system via the chain reactions, which typically employ $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ as radical precursors and $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+} / \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ (or other low-valent tran-sition-metal complexes) as electron-donor/acceptor for triggering or terminating the generation of $\bullet \mathrm{OH}$ radicals. In addition, photocatalysis oxidation is on the basis of the properties of semiconductors [5,6]. When the photocatalysts absorb photons with energy greater than or equal to the band gap, the photocatalytic reaction generates photogenerated electrons and holes that subsequently react with substances such as

$\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the system, yielding strongly oxidizing active free radicals (typically $\bullet \mathrm{OH}$ and $\bullet \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$).

Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) technique commonly involves the chemical surface modification and subsequent mechanical material removal, aiming to achieve atomically smooth and defect-free surfaces. Recently, AOPs (typically photocatalysis and Fenton-related systems) and the as-generated ROS (typically $\bullet \mathrm{OH}$ radicals) have been introduced into conventional CMP processes. Up to now, a series of Fenton (or photo-Fenton and electro-Fenton) reactions assisted CMP [4], [5], Fenton-like reactions assisted CMP [16], [17], [18], photochemical (or photocatalytic) mechanical polishing (PCMP) [19], [20], [21], [22], photocatalysis combined with Fenton reaction assisted CMP [26,27], photoelectrochemically mechanical polishing (PECMP) [28] techniques have been developed for improved polishing performance. It is noteworthy that these novel polishing methods can be collectively referred to as ROS (or free radical)-assisted CMP. Efficient material removal can be achieved by utilizing highly active groups for the oxidation and corrosion of hard and brittle materials (fused silica, silicon carbide, gallium nitride, etc.) coupled with the friction and wear of abrasive particles. Polishing results clearly indicate that ROS (or free radical)-assisted CMP can not only effectively improve removal efficiency but also achieve non-damage surfaces with atomic-level roughness. Importantly, ROS-assisted surface oxidation (or modification) is much effective and clean than traditional chemical oxidants such as sodium hypochlorite, potassium permanganate, potassium chromate, etc. Consequently, it is reasonable to believe that ROS-assisted CMP can be expected to develop into a clean, high-efficiency, and high-quality polishing technique.

In CMP practices, the surface quality and removal rate are a coupled result of the surface modification and mechanical removal. The type, structure, and property of abrasives play a crucial role in final polishing performance. The development of novel abrasive systems can be expected to provide valuable insights into the coordinating the contradiction between surface quality and removal efficiency during CMP. Thanks to the advancements of particle design and preparation technologies, a series of modified [29], doped [20,30], [31], [32], porous [33], [34], [35], core-shell structured [20,22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], and irregular-shaped [40,41] abrasive systems have been proposed and applied in CMP, PCMP, electrochemical mechanical polishing (ECMP), etc. As confirmed by the experimental results, the synthetic abrasives with unique components and structures contributed to surface quality improvement and/or removal rate enhancement, possibly resulting from the regulation and optimization of the interfacial contact state and abrasion behavior between abrasives and surfaces.

Dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSNs) [42,43] have three-dimensional nanochannels and layered nanocavities, thus leading to a larger pore size, a higher pore volume, and more open channels than typical meso-SiO2 materials such as SBA 15, MCM-41, etc. In particular, different nanoscale guests can be readily loaded into these channels as chemically active sites or transported through radial porous structures, thus creating novel composites with specific functional properties. In our previous work [16], the Cu -doped $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2}$ abrasives were developed using a facile solvothermal method. CMP results on silica films revealed that the $\mathrm{Cu}^{2+}{ }^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ Fenton-like system contributed to the $\bullet \mathrm{OH}$ production and thereby achieved an enhanced removal efficiency. Thus, introducing foreign cations into meso-SiO2 frameworks may hold great potential in CMP practices. As one of the most popular CMP abrasives, $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ nanoparticles have received widespread attentions in the past decades. For example, Lei and coworkers [44,45] prepared a series of Sm , Nd, Ce , or La-doped colloidal $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ abrasives by a seed-induced growth method. And the enhanced removal rates toward sapphire substrates might be attributed to the solid-state chemical reactions between the doped $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ abrasives and the reacted sapphire surfaces. To the best of our knowledge, the $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}$ co-doped colloidal $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ or meso- $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ abrasives have not been reported yet.

Inspired by previous works, herein we report some recent studies on
the design and synthesis of active and efficient abrasive systems toward ROS (or free radical)-assisted CMP. Herein, the uniform DMSNs synthesized by a typical oil-water biphase stratification approach were single-doped with Ce species and co-doped with $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}$ species through a simple impregnation-calcination procedure. The $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}$ co-doped DMSNs (Ce/Cu-DMSNs) materials offered an improved polishing performance and an enhanced degradation activity by compared with those of pure and Ce single-doped DMSNs (Ce-DMSNs). Various analytical techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive spectrometry mapping, nitrogen adsorption-desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, etc., are used in this work. A possible polishing mechanism toward the developed $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ abrasive systems is proposed according to the synergistic effect of ROS-enhanced surface modification and soft abrasion-assisted material removal.

## 2. Experimental section

### 2.1. Materials and reagents

All chemical reagents including cerium nitrate hexahydrate (Ce $\left.\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right), \mathrm{AR}$ ), hydrated copper nitrate $\left(\mathrm{Cu}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2} \cdot 3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right.$, AR), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, AR), tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, AR), triethanolamine (TEA, AR), n-hexane ( $\left.\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{14}, \mathrm{AR}\right)$, ethanol $\left(\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{6} \mathrm{O}\right.$, AR), hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}, 30 \mathrm{wt} \%, \mathrm{AR}\right)$, tetracycline (TC, CP) were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China) and used as received without further purification. Deionized (DI) water was used throughout the experimental processes.

### 2.2. Synthesis of DMSNs, Ce-DMSNs, Cu-DMSNs, and Ce/Cu-DMSNs

The DMSNs with a particle size of $70-80 \mathrm{~nm}$ were prepared via the biphase stratification approach [46] with a little modification. Briefly, 0.18 g of TEA and 1.0 g of CTAB were added to 60 mL of DI water and magnetically stirred ( $150 \mathrm{r} / \mathrm{min}$ ), coupled with a standard Teflon-coated stirring bar with a length of 3 cm at $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 60 min in a round-bottomed flask. Then, a mixture of 7.44 mL of TEOS and 13.8 mL of $n$-hexane was charged into the water-CTAB-TEA system, and the solution was kept at $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in an oil bath under magnetic stirring ( 150 $\mathrm{r} / \mathrm{min}$ ). After 24 h , the upper oil phase was removed carefully, and the resulting products were collected by repeated centrifugation ( 10000 $\mathrm{r} / \mathrm{min}$ ) and washed for several times with DI water and ethanol to remove the residual reactants. The collected samples were dried in an oven at $75^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, followed by calcination in a muffle furnace at $650^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 2 h to remove the CTAB templates. Finally, the DMSNs products were obtained for next experiments.

The $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ were prepared by two-step impregnation and thermolysis procedures. A typical synthesis was described as following. Generally, the as-made DMSNs ( 0.30 g ) were impregnated with the mixture containing $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \quad(0.21 \mathrm{~g}, \quad 0.25 \mathrm{mmol}), \mathrm{Cu}$ $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2} \cdot 3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(0.12 \mathrm{~g}, 0.25 \mathrm{mmol})$, and ethanol ( 20 mL ) at room temperature, followed by ultrasonication for 10 min . Then the suspension was aged for 2 h under magnetic stirring (200-300 r/min). Subsequently, the mixture was heated to $45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in an oil bath for the complete evaporation of ethanol. Finally, the solids were was calcined in a muffle furnace at $550^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 2 h . For comparison, $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ and $\mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ were synthesized by following the similar procedure as described above, except using the $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(0.42 \mathrm{~g}, 0.50 \mathrm{mmol})$ and the Cu $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2} \cdot 3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(0.24 \mathrm{~g}, 0.50 \mathrm{mmol})$ precursors, respectively.

### 2.3. Structure characterization

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and $\mathrm{O}, \mathrm{Ce}$, and/or Cu elemental mapping images were obtained using a ZEISS SUPRA-55 electron microscope equipped with embedded energy

dispersive spectrometer (EDS) system and operated at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV . The samples were coated with a thin layer of gold before SEM observations. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100 electron microscope, operating at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV . Prior to the analysis, the samples were dispersed into ethanol with ultrasonic treatment for 10 min , and a drop of the suspension was placed on a carbon-coated copper grid and dried in air. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured using a Micromeritics TriStar 3020 instrument at 77 K . The specific surface areas were calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and the pore-size distributions were estimated from the adsorption branch data using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analyses were performed on a Nicolet Avatar-370 spectrometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed on a Rigaku D/Max 2500 PC diffractometer using $\mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{K} \alpha$ radiation source $(\lambda=1.54056 \AA$ ). The chemical states and compositions of the samples were explored using an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, PHI-5000 VersaProbe III, ULVAC-PHI) equipped with a monochromatic $\mathrm{Al} \mathrm{Ka}(h v=1486.6 \mathrm{eV})$ radiation source. The binding energies were calibrated using the C 1 s reference peak at 284.8 eV .

### 2.4. Polishing experiments

All polishing tests were performed on a precision polisher (Tegra-Force-1-TrgraPol-15, Struers, Denmark) coupled with a porous polyurethane pad (MD-Chem, Struers). Thermally grown $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ wafers (ca. $1.2 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in oxide layer thickness) with a size of ca. $20 \mathrm{~mm} \times 20 \mathrm{~mm} \times 0.5$ mm (length $\times$ width $\times$ thickness) were used as processing targets. In UV radiation-assisted PCMP processes, a 250 W UV lamp (wavelength 365 nm ) served as an UV light source, and placed ca. 30 cm above the polishing pad. The diagram of the experimental device is shown in Fig. 1. The process conditions were as follows: polishing pressure of 3.0-3.5 psi, head rotation speed of $120 \mathrm{r} / \mathrm{min}$, plate rotation speed of $90 \mathrm{r} / \mathrm{min}$, slurry flow rate of $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, polishing time of 2 min . Typically, the slurries were composed of abrasive particles (DMSNs, Ce-DMSNs, or $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ ) with a solid content of $1.0 \mathrm{wt} \%, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}(1.0 \mathrm{wt} \%)$, PVP ( $1.0 \mathrm{wt} \%$ ), and DI water. And the slurry pH was adjusted to $8.0-8.5$ using 0.1 M NaOH . The slurries were continuously stirred to achieve uniformly dispersed suspensions. Prior to PCMP experiments, the

polishing slurries were also treated with UV light irradiation for 10 min .
After polishing, the workpieces were rinsed immediately by ultrasonication with ethanol, acetone, and DI water to remove the adhered abrasive particles and other residues from the surfaces. The surface morphologies of the substrates before and after finishing were evaluated using a non-contact 3D optical profilometer (Contour GT, Bruker) and an atomic force microscope (AFM, Nanoman VS coupled with a Dimention V controller, Veeco, currently Bruker) in tapping mode. Commercial silicon probes (Tap300Al-G, obtained from BudgetSensors) were used in all AFM measurements. The typical tip radius, resonance frequency, and spring constant are $\sim 10 \mathrm{~nm}, 300 \mathrm{kHz}$, and $40 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}$, respectively. And the scan speed, scan area, and scan resolution were fixed at $1.0 \mathrm{~Hz}, 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m} \times 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, and $512 \mathrm{px} \times 512 \mathrm{px}$, respectively. AFM measurement positions were randomly selected from the surfaces in order to ensure the credibility of the roughness determinations. In addition, the finished surfaces and the abrasive particles in used slurries were also examined by SEM observations (Regulus 8100, Hitachi).

The weight of the workpiece before and after polishing was measured using an electric balance (XS105, Mettler Toledo) with a 0.01 mg resolution to determine the material removal rate (MRR), as shown in equation (1).
$M R R=\Delta m / \rho s t$
where $\Delta m$ is the weight loss of the workpiece, $\rho$ is the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ layer density (ca. $2.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ), $s$ is the workpiece surface area, and $t$ is the polishing time. In this work, the provided MRR and roughness data were determined by averaging values obtained from the three repeated tests.

## 3. Results and discussion

### 3.1. Structural and physicochemical properties

Fig. 2 shows the FESEM images and the corresponding particledistribution plots of DMSNs, $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}, \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$, and $\mathrm{Ce} /$ $\mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ samples. In this work, the average diameter and standard deviation of the particles were determined via the Nano Measurer Software (V1.2) by counting 60-80 nanospheres for statistical appreciations. As shown in Fig. 2a, the bare DMSNs have relatively smooth appearances and uniform spherical morphologies with an average particle size of $72.0 \pm 6.5 \mathrm{~nm}$. After doping and co-doping with Ce and/or Cu species, the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (Fig. 2b), $\mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (Fig. 2c), and $\mathrm{Ce} /$ $\mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (Fig. 2d) still maintain the initial spherical shapes, also indicating the good structural stability of DMSNs during the synthesis procedures. In addition, the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}, \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$, and $\mathrm{Ce} /$ $\mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ reveal comparable diameters with narrow particle sizedistributions, namely, $74.2 \pm 6.2 \mathrm{~nm}, 75.4 \pm 6.8 \mathrm{~nm}$, and $74.6 \pm 7.4$

nm . Furthermore, the relatively rough surfaces and slightly increased sizes further suggest that there are some Ce and/or Cu oxide species grafted at DMSNs surfaces.

The SEM-EDS analyses (Fig. 3) were also employed to analyze the chemical compositions of the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ samples, identifying that the elements of $\mathrm{Si}, \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{Ce}$, and Cu (for $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ ) were electrodeposited. As confirmed by the corresponding EDS elemental mapping images, the Si (red), O (green), Ce (blue), and Cu (purple, for $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ ) elements are homogeneously distributed in the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (Fig. 3a) and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (Fig. 3b) particles. The presented EDS mapping data verify the uniform introduction of Ce and/ or Cu species into the DMSNs matrixes using the
impregnation-calcination approach.
The crystalline and amorphous nature of the DMSNs, Ce-DMSNs, $\mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$, and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ samples were analyzed by powder XRD patterns. For bare DMSNs (Fig. 4a), only a broad peak located at ca. $2 \theta=$ $21.8^{\circ}$ can be observed, indicating the presence of amorphous (noncrystalline) silica materials [47,48]. All three doped DMSNs samples also reveal the amorphous diffraction peaks, which can be attributed to the involved amorphous DMSNs frameworks. For $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (Fig. 4b), the diffraction peaks located at ca. $2 \theta=28.3^{\circ}, 32.8^{\circ}, 47.4^{\circ}, 56.1^{\circ}, 69.1^{\circ}$, and $76.5^{\circ}$ can be indexed to the characteristic (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), and (331) reflections of cubic fluorite-type phase $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials [49,50]. In the case of $\mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (Fig. 4c), the sharp diffraction peaks at ca. $2 \theta=32.6^{\circ}, 35.5^{\circ}, 38.8^{\circ}, 48.8^{\circ}$, and $61.6^{\circ}$, corresponding to the (110), (-111), (111), (-112), and (-113) crystal planes of monoclinic CuO phase [51,52], supporting the presence of the well-crystallized CuO. Furthermore, the characteristic XRD diffraction peaks of both cubic phase $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and monoclinic phase CuO can be clearly observed from Fig. 4d, indicating the coexistence of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and CuO nanocrystals in $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$.

More structural characterizations on DMSNs, $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$, and $\mathrm{Ce} /$ $\mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ were performed using TEM observations. By comparison with initial DMSNs (Fig. 5a), there are no significant changes in particle morphology, particle size, and pore structure for the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (Fig. 5b) and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (Fig. 5c) samples. In addition, some black dots can be found at the Ce and/or Cu-doped DMSNs surfaces, implying the formation of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and/or CuO nanoparticles [53]. For the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image gives the interplanar spacing of 0.31 nm , corresponding to the exposed (111) plane of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. In the case of $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$, two sets of lattice fringes with spacing values of 0.31 and 0.23 nm are tracked, which can be indexed to the (111) plane of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and (111) facet of CuO [54], respectively. The results of HRTEM investigations are in line with the XRD analyses.

Fig. 6 shows the FT-IR spectra of the DMSNs, Ce-DMSNs, $\mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$, and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ samples. The intense IR signal centered at ca. $3434 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ can be ascribed to the stretching vibration of the sialon and -OH groups [55]. The H-O-H bending vibration mode appeared at ca. $1635 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ may be attributed to the adsorption water molecules within the DMSNs-involved materials [49]. The characteristic IR bands at ca. $468 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}, 806 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, and $1083 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ can be assigned to the in-plane bending of $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$, the symmetric vibration of $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}$, and the stretching vibration of $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}$ in the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ structure [56], respectively. Furthermore, the IR signals at ca. $1083 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ for the doped DMSNs samples are evident broader than that of undoped ones, which can be responsible for the incorporation of Ce and/or Cu ions into the silica frameworks [57]. Moreover, the IR band near $968 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ can be ascribed to the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH}$ vibrations. As reported in literatures [58,59], the increase in the intensity of this signal possibly resulted from the incorporation of heteroatom into silica materials. Consequently, the increased IR band intensity at ca. $968 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ can be attributed to the framework $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{M}$ (M: Ce and/Cu) stretching vibrations for the Ce and/or Cu doped DMSNs samples. The results of FT-IR analyses further suggest that a portion of Ce and/or Cu species may be incorporated into the silica frameworks of mesoporous $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}, \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$, and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$, even though it is hard to quantify the incorporated amounts in the silicate frameworks. Nevertheless, the characteristic IR signals on $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and CuO cannot be clearly detected. Many available literatures [57-59] have reported the similar results on metal-incorporated mesoporous silica materials, such as Al-MCM-41, Cu/Al-MCM-41, Cu-SBA-15, La-SBA-15, etc.

To determine the textural features of DMSNs, Ce-DMSNs, and Ce/ Cu-DMSNs, the low-temperature $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore-size distributions were investigated, as shown in Fig. 7. According to International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry classification, all isotherms (Fig. 7a-c, e) show a typical Type IV model with a $\mathrm{H} 2 / \mathrm{H} 3$-type hysteresis loop at a high relative pressure, indicating the presence of dendritic-like mesopores [46]. The BET surface area and

pore volume of the blank DMSNs were determined to be $605.8 \mathrm{~m}^{3} / \mathrm{g}$ and $1.18 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \mathrm{g}$, respectively. However, the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ are shown to suffer a considerable loss on surface areas ( 265.9 and $299.7 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ ) and pore volumes ( 0.60 and $0.66 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} / \mathrm{g}$ ). It may be
attributed to the blocking of the pores of DMSNs matrixes by $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and/or CuO nanoparticles and their aggregates [57-60]. It also suggests that there are some $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and/or CuO nanocrystals formed within the DMSNs mesochannels. Fig. 7b-d, f shows the BJH pore-size distributions

of the pure and doped DMSNs samples, as determined from the adsorption branch data. All samples exhibit a good mesoporous structural ordering and a narrow pore-size distribution. In addition, the DMSNs, $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$, and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ have a comparable average pore diameter, namely, $9.2,9.0$, and 8.9 nm .

The chemical composition and valence/oxidation state on the obtained samples were further tracked using XPS investigations. The
survey XPS spectra confirm the presence of $\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{Si}, \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{Ce}$, and/or Cu elements on the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (Fig. 8a) and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (Fig. 8b) surfaces. Ce 3d XPS spectrum commonly demonstrates complex features, possibly resulting from the hybridization with ligand orbitals and fractional occupancy of the valence 4 f orbitals. The complex Ce 3d spectra of the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (Fig. 8c) and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (Fig. 8d) materials were deconvoluted into five pairs of peaks. Herin, two sets of spin orbit

polymorphisms ( $\mathrm{Ce} 3 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce} 3 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}$ ) represent $u$ and $v$, respectively. For $\mathrm{Ce} \cdots$ DMSNs ( $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu} \cdots$ DMSNs) samples, three pairs of peaks centered at ca. 883.8 (883.2) and 901.5 (903.4) eV, 888.4 (888.6) and 906.8 (907.8) eV as well as 897.8 (898.6) and 915.9 (916.0) eV can be ascribed to $\mathrm{Ce} 3 \mathrm{~d}^{9} 4 f^{2} \mathrm{O} 2 \mathrm{p}^{4}(v, \mathrm{u}), \mathrm{Ce} 3 \mathrm{~d}^{9} 4 f^{1} \mathrm{O} 2 \mathrm{p}^{5}\left(v^{\prime \prime}, u^{\prime \prime}\right)$ and $\mathrm{Ce} 3 \mathrm{~d}^{9} 4 f^{0} \mathrm{O} 2 \mathrm{p}^{6}$ ( $v^{\prime \prime \prime}, u^{\prime \prime \prime}$ ) of Ce (IV) species, respectively. The other two pairs of peaks at 881.7 (881.8) and 899.6 (900.6) eV as well as 885.9 (885.9) and 903.6 (905.1) eV, labeled as $v_{0}, u_{0}$ and $v^{\prime}, u^{\prime}$, can be assigned to the $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})$ species with $\mathrm{Ce} 3 \mathrm{~d}^{9} 4 f^{2} \mathrm{O} 2 \mathrm{p}^{5}$ and $\mathrm{Ce} 3 \mathrm{~d}^{9} 4 f^{1} \mathrm{O} 2 \mathrm{p}^{6}$ final states [61]. These results confirm that two valence states of $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{IV})$ and $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})$ coexist in Ce- and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}$-doped DMSNs materials. Furthermore, the Ce (III) concentration can be estimated through semi-quantitative calculation using equation (4) [62-64]. And the oxygen vacancy (Vo) content in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ can be calculated according to equation (5) [62,64]. The Ce(III) and Vo concentrations of $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu} \cdots$ DMSNs are $39.5 \%$ and $9.9 \%$, respectively, which are higher than those of $\mathrm{Ce} \cdots$ DMSNs ( $32.8 \%$ and 8.2 $\%$ ).
$\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III}) \%=\mathrm{A}[\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})] / \mathrm{A}[\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})+\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{IV})]$
$\mathrm{Vo} \%=1-(3[\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})]+4[\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{IV})]) / 4$
The O 1s XPS analyses were also performed to determine the different types of oxygen species in the synthesized materials. Three different O 1s peaks can be noticed in the $\mathrm{Ce} \cdots$ DMSNs (Fig. 9a) and $\mathrm{Ce} /$ $\mathrm{Cu} \cdots$ DMSNs (Fig. 9b) samples. As proposed in literatures [65,66], the binding energy centered at $528.8-532.6 \mathrm{eV}$ can be assigned to the
lattice oxygen (such as $\mathrm{O}^{2-}$ species) of the metal oxides, while the shoulder peak located at $531.5-533.2 \mathrm{eV}$ can be attributed to oxygen vacancies or chemisorbed oxygen species. Moreover, the binding energy at $532.1-533.5 \mathrm{eV}$ can be associated with other oxygen species, including weakly bounded water molecules.

It is commonly recognized that CuO possess characteristic highintensity shake-up satellites [67-69]. Fig. 9c presents the Cu 2p XPS spectrum of $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu} \cdots$ DMSNs samples. Herin, the $\mathrm{Cu} 2 \mathrm{p}_{3 / 2}$ and $2 \mathrm{p}_{1 / 2}$ core-levels peaks are located at ca. 933.0 and 952.2 eV , respectively. The recorded core level spectrum also shows the signature of the presence of shake-up satellites. The peak located at ca. 941.0 eV is the signature for the presence of satellite peak of $\mathrm{Cu} 2 \mathrm{p}_{3 / 2}$, and the satellite peak for the $\mathrm{Cu} 2 \mathrm{p}_{1 / 2}$ is located at ca. 959.3 eV . Moreover, the peak at 932.1 eV can be ascribed to the reduced copper species $\left(\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{I})\right.$ and/or $\left.\mathrm{Cu}^{0}\right)$ [61, 67-69]. Nevertheless, the presence of $\mathrm{Cu}^{0}$ should be ignored in this work. Consequently, both $\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{II})$ and $\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{I})$ oxidation states may also coexist in $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu} \cdots$ DMSNs samples.

### 3.2. Degradation activities

The catalytic activities and ROS production efficiencies of DMSNs, $\mathrm{Ce} \cdots \mathrm{DMSNs}$, and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu} \cdots \mathrm{DMSNs}$ materials were evaluated from the degradation tests toward TC. The experiments were performed on a GHX-2 photochemical reaction apparatus (Yangzhou University Town Science and Education Instrument Co., Ltd.) equipped with a watercooled 300 W Xeon lamp. In a typical experiment, a round bottom

flask containing a mixture of 25 mg photocatalyst and 250 mL TC solution ( $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ ) was placed ca. 10 cm from the light source. First, the suspension was magnetically stirred for 60 min in the dark environment at room temperature, ensuring the adsorption/desorption equilibrium between the TC and DMSNs-based particles. Then, 1.0 mL of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ solution was added into the reactor. After that, the suspension was illuminated with constant stirring, and 5 mL aliquots were collected every 10 min , followed by centrifugation ( 8000 rpm ) to remove the catalyst particles. To determine the concentration of residual TC, the supernatant was analyzed using an UV-vis spectrophotometer (722, JINGHUR Instruments) at the maximum absorption wavelength of TC $\left(\lambda_{\max } \approx 356\right.$ nm ). The degradation efficiency $(\eta)$ was evaluated by measuring the change of absorbance via the following equation (2).
$\eta=\left(1-C_{t} / C_{0}\right) \times 100 \%$
Herein, $C_{0}$ is the initial concentration of TC, and $C_{t}$ is the concentration of TC after degradation reaction. At a low TC content and the weak adsorption, the degradation reaction kinetics generally follow the Langmuir-Hinshelwood Kinetic model. And the reaction rate $(k)$ was also determined using the following equation (3).
$\ln (C)=-k t+\ln \left(C_{0}\right)$
where $k$ is the pseudo-first-order reaction rate constant $\left(\min ^{-1}\right)$ and $t$ is the reaction time. These procedures were triplicated for all DMSNs, $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$, and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ samples.

### 3.3. Polishing performances

### 3.3.1. Surface quality

The topographical changes of the surfaces before and after polishing were explored by AFM analyses, including two-dimensional (2D) height images, three-dimensional (3D) oblique images, lateral views, line-scan traces, surface area difference (SAD), etc. The lower color contrast ratio in height images commonly suggest the better surface quality [70]. The AFM height image and the corresponding line trace of the as-received wafer surface are provided in Fig. 10. As determined by the NanoScope Analysis Software (Bruker, V1.40), the average $R a, R q$, and $R z$ roughness over $5.0 \times 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ of the surface prior to polishing are 0.693 , 0.829 , and 1.41 nm , respectively. Meanwhile, the profile curvature tracked along the dotted line (Line 0) shows the maximum peak height (MPH) of ca. 1.83 nm and the maximum valley depth (MVP) of ca. -1.54 nm , thus revealing a peak-to-valley (PV) value of 3.37 nm . In addition, the SAD value of the pristine surface is approximately $0.093 \%$.

The CMP and/or PCMP performance on the three types of DMSNs, $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}, \mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ abrasive systems were also evaluated in terms of AFM analyses. As shown in Figs. 11 and 12, the as-prepared abrasives enable the clear improvements in surface quality by comparison with the original substrate, and allow the atomically smooth and scratch-free surfaces. In addition, the surface characteristics including $R a, R q$, and $R z$ roughness as well as SAD data are listed in Table 1. After CMP with the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ abrasives, the surfaces reveal a lower average $R a(0.123$ and 0.141 nm$), Rq(0.152$ and 0.172

nm ), and $R z(0.173$ and 0.183 nm$)$ data than those after CMP with pure DMSNs ( $0.167,0.223,0.326 \mathrm{~nm}$ ). Moreover, the topographical variation ranges reduced from $0.50 \mathrm{~nm} \sim-0.43 \mathrm{~nm}$ (DMSNs, PV $=0.93 \mathrm{~nm}$, Lines 1 and 2) to $0.43 \mathrm{~nm} \sim-0.38 \mathrm{~nm}$ (Ce-DMSNs, PV $=0.81 \mathrm{~nm}$, Lines 3 and 4) and $0.35 \mathrm{~nm}--0.41 \mathrm{~nm}\left(\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}, \mathrm{PV}=0.76 \mathrm{~nm}\right.$, Lines 5 and 6). And the average SAD data decreased from $0.00645 \%$ (DMSNs) to $0.00355 \%$ (Ce-DMSNs) and $0.00358 \%$ (Ce/Cu-DMSNs). The results of AFM analyses clearly confirm that the Ce single-doping and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}$ codoping contribute to the surface quality improvement for the DMSNs-based abrasive systems. In this work, the best surface quality was achieved with $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ abrasive systems under PCMP
conditions. Herin, the $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ offered the smallest average $R a$ $(0.120 \mathrm{~nm}), R q(0.144 \mathrm{~nm})$, and $R z(0.149 \mathrm{~nm})$ roughness as well as SAD data ( $0.00299 \%$ ). And the corresponding MPH and MVP are 0.35 and $-0.45 \mathrm{~nm}(\mathrm{PV}=0.80 \mathrm{~nm}$, Lines 7 and 8 ), respectively.

The morphological evolutions of the surfaces before and after CMP and/or PCMP with DMSNs-based abrasives were also tracked in terms of the 3D-AFM images and the lateral views driven from the corresponding 2D-AFM height images. As shown in Fig. 13, the Ce single-doped and Ce/ Cu co-doped DMSNs abrasives effectively remove the most of nanopeaks at the original surfaces without introducing other new damages or scratches, contributing to topographical variation reductions and thus revealing superior planarization performance. In addition, the wafers after CMP and PCMP with $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ particles were selected for surface morphology examinations at a large scanning scale of $772.1 \times$ $962.8 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. As shown in Fig. 14, the finished workpieces present ultrasmooth mirror appearances, and obvious surface defects such as residues, scratches, pits, cracks, etc. can hardly be observed.

Generally, the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives with smaller sizes and/or more surface $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})$ sites can strongly adhere to the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surfaces due to the created $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds during and after polishing [71]. Herein, the results of SEM observations (Fig. 15) on the surfaces after PCMP with $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ abrasives verify that the adhered particles can be effectively removed from the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surfaces without polluting the polished samples. The $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ abrasives in used PCMP slurries were also collected and detected by SEM in order to estimate the particle structure stability. With respect to the original particles (Fig. 3), there are no clear changes in particle morphology, size and distribution, as presented in Fig. 16, thus revealing the good structure stabilities of the as-synthesized abrasives under the interface contact, friction and wear involved in material removal processes.

In CMP applications, the ultimate surface quality, defect, and damage can be regarded as a consequence of the interfacial interaction between abrasives and substrates, which will be highly affected by the properties of abrasive particles in slurries, such as type, morphology, structure, component, particle size and distribution, mechanical properties (typically elastic modulus $E$ and hardness), etc. As reported in our previous work [34], the average $E$ values of individual DMSNs (ca. 5.0 nm of pore size) were determined to be ca. 4.5 GPa using AFM force-curve technique and Hertz contact model, which were much lower than those of nonporous $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ materials (72-76 GPa [72]). In this work, the as-prepared DMSNs-based nanospheres with large porosity and abundant mesopores (ca. 9.0 nm of pore size) may also feature the reduced overall modulus and hardness, which can contribute to the optimization of physical contact behavior between the abrasive and the workpiece. The schematic illustration of the possible interface contacts between the substrate surface and the DMSNs-based abrasive is proposed in Fig. 17. During CMP and PCMP processes, the low-modulus DMSNs-involved particles might undergo slightly elastic deformation under an applied down force, thus avoiding the surface damage originated from hard abrasive collisions. It can also help reduce the indentation depth and increase the real contact area between the abrasives and the surfaces [16,21-23,28,32-36,73-75]. Consequently, the DMSNs-based abrasives offered the superior surface quality, e.g., nearly defect-free and atomic-level finish. The developed abrasive systems can better meet the requirements of advanced polishing slurry abrasives for achieving high-quality surfaces.

### 3.3.2. Removal efficiency

Material removal efficiency (or MRR) is another critical indicator for evaluating polishing performance. Herein, the MRR data of three abrasive types are summarized in Table 2. For CMP processes, the average MRR of $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ is $152 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$, which is a $123.5 \%$ and $63.4 \%$ increasesments with respect to those of DMSNs ( $68 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ) and $\mathrm{Ce} /$ $\mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}(93 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min})$, respectively. Under PCMP experimental conditions, the $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ abrasive systems achieved the highest average MRR of $184 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$. These results clearly indicate that both

$\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}$ co-doping treatment and UV irradiation introduction are conducive to enhancing the removal efficiency of DMSNs-based abrasives.

It is generally recognized that the MRR on $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}-\mathrm{CMP}$ depends on the surface modification/corrosion and the friction/abrasion removal. The circular formation and removal of the chemically reacted productions play a crucial role in the final MRR. In the case of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$-polishing with $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives, the tribochemical process or chemical-tooth theory (the formation and breakage of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds) was first proposed by Cook [76]. In-depth investigations [77-83] further confirm that the surface Ce (III) sites can be expected to be active sites for the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})$ -$\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ structures. Typically, the $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})-\mathrm{OH}$ bonding at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces could react with $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH}$ bonding at $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surfaces and thus produced Ce (III) - $\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ structures, as described in equations (6) and (7). After $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bond formations, the free electrons in $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})$ might migrate to the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surface, further weakening or even breaking the stable $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}$ covalent bonds [83,84]. As a consequence, the formation and breakage of $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds are responsible for the enhanced removal
efficiency of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ toward $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$.
$\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})-\mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{HO}-\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})$
$\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})-\mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{HO}-\mathrm{Si} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
For $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ samples, the comprehensive analyses of XRD, HRTEM, $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ adsorption-desorption, and EDS maps suggest that there are some $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanocrystals located at DMSNs surfaces or formed within DMSNs mesochannels. XPS results further confirm the coexistence of Ce (III) and $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{IV})$ species. In this work, the constructed $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ materials can also be expected to be a simple heterogeneous Fenton-like system in the presence of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$. The catalytic decomposition of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ by $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III}) / \mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{IV})$ couples can generate highly active ROS such as $\bullet \mathrm{OH}$, $\bullet \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$, etc., as shown in equations (8) and (9) [85]. As proposed in literatures [24,36], the produced ROS (typically $\bullet \mathrm{OH}$ ) may also react with the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$, thus accelerating the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bond breakage and the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH}$ and $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ formations, as shown in equation (10).
$\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{IV})+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})+\bullet \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$
$\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{IV})+\bullet \mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}$
$\bullet \mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{SiO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$
As proposed by reactive molecular dynamics simulations [82], the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surface with a higher degree of hydroxylation (thicker $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ layer) might be more reactive, implying that proper chemical treatment should be fundamental to augment the removal efficiency. The developed $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ abrasive systems can be expected to contribute to the formation and breakage of $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH}$ and/or $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds, possibly due to the tribochemical activity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and the generated ROS in Fenton-like reaction. Consequently, the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ abrasives achieve a higher average MRR ( $93 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ) than that of bare DMSNs ones (68

$\mathrm{nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ).
Heterogeneous Fenton-like reactions with transition metal ions (typically $\mathrm{Cu}, \mathrm{Co}, \mathrm{Mn}$, etc.) at low oxidation states and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ have been confirmed to be available and effective AOP processes. For $\mathrm{Ce} /$ $\mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ materials, more ROS (typically $\bullet \mathrm{OH}$ ) can be produced after introducing the variable valence element of Cu , possibly resulting from the synergy between CuO with $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and the electron transfer between $\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{I}) / \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{II})$ and $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III}) / \mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{IV})$ [86], as described in equation (11)-(14). It further contributes to the formation of $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH}$ structure at $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surfaces. Fig. 18 shows the schematic illustration of the possible ROS production mechanism for $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$.
$\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{II})+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{I})+\bullet \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$
$\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{I})+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{II})+\bullet \mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}$
$\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{IV})+\bullet \mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
$\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{II})+\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{I})+\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{IV})$
XPS results reveal that the $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ possess more $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})$ ions (ca. $39.5 \%$ ) than that of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (ca. $32.8 \%$ ), further contributing to the formation and breakage of $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonding. The enhanced surface modification and tribochemistry reaction can be responsible for the effective removal against $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ materials. Therefore, the co-doped $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ abrasive systems allow an evidently enhanced CMP. $M R R\left(152 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}\right.$ in average) compared to the single-doped $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSN}$ ones ( $93 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ in average).

In the UV irradiation-assisted PCMP with $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$, the photocatalysis activity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanocrystals may be also involved in the ROS productions. When the slurry abrasives were irradiated by UV light, the
photoexcited electrons ( $\mathrm{e}^{-}$) from the valence band (VB) of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ could be transferred to the conduction band (CB) of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, thereby creating positive holes ( $\mathrm{h}^{+}$) in the VB of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The photogenerated holes left behind in VB could oxidize the surface-adsorbed $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$and/or $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to generate $\bullet \mathrm{OH}$ radicals. The photoinduced $\mathrm{e}^{-}$could react with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ to create $\bullet \mathrm{OH}$ radicals. In addition, the $\mathrm{e}^{-}$might also reduce the surface-adsorbed $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and then produce the $\bullet \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$radicals, which could further react to generate $\bullet \mathrm{OH}$ radicals. The procedures on ROS productions involved in photocatalysis are described as the following equation (15)-(20) [87]. Additionally, the surface Vo and $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})$ defects of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanocrystals can be expected to serve as $\mathrm{e}^{-}$acceptors, thereby inhibiting the recombination rate of photoinduced $\mathrm{e}^{-}-\mathrm{h}^{+}$pairs and thus benefiting the production of active free radical groups [88]. As mentioned above, the enrichment of ROS can accelerate the formation of the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH}$ bonds at $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surfaces (chemically reacted soft layer). By comparison with CMP conditions, the $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ abrasive systems offer another MRR improvement in PCMP experiments ( $184 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ vs $152 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ).
$\mathrm{CeO}_{2}+\mathrm{h} v \rightarrow \mathrm{~h}^{+}+\mathrm{e}^{-}$
$\mathrm{h}^{+}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \bullet \mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$
$\mathrm{h}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} \rightarrow \bullet \mathrm{OH}$
$\mathrm{e}^{-}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \bullet \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$
$\mathrm{e}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{OH}^{-}+\bullet \mathrm{OH}$
$\bullet \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{O}_{2}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}+\bullet \mathrm{OH}$
In this work, the ROS production efficiencies of the pure and doped DMSNs were also validated in terms of the degradation tests over TC.

The variation in TC concentration with degradation time and the plot of $-\ln \left(C / C_{0}\right)$ versus degradation time are shown in Fig. 19. The presented data reveal that degradation efficiencies follow the order: Ce/ Cu-DMSNs (with UV irradiation) $>\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}>\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}>$ DMSNs. With the assistance of UV irradiation, the $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}$ co-doped DMSNs greatly shorten the degradation time, and achieve the highest TC degradation efficiency of $98.1 \%$ in 60 min with the highest degradation rate constant $k$ of $5.51 \times 10^{-2} \mathrm{~min}^{-1}$. These results support that the $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ abrasive systems are conducive to the production of more ROS in polishing slurries during UV irradiation-assisted PCMP, thus allowing superior material removal efficiency. However, the in-situ production of active free radicals involved in ROS-assisted polishing can hardly be monitored due to their extremely short lifetime [89,90]. In the subsequent work, more solid evidence on the generated ROS and active sites will be further investigated in terms of electron paramagnetic resonance, electron spin resonance, free radical quenching experiments, tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, in-situ FT-IR, in-situ Raman, etc.

## 4. Conclusions

In this work, the Ce single-doped and $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}$ co-doped DMSNs were synthesized by a simple impregnation-calcination procedure and characterized by several state-of-the-art techniques, and then applied in ROS-enhanced polishing as novel abrasive systems. SEM, TEM, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption studies revealed that there were no appreciable changes in particle size, pore diameter, and mesoporous nature. FT-IR investigations implied the existence of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ and/or $\mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ structures in the doped DMSNs matrixes. XRD results confirmed the presence of crystalline $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and CuO , which might be exposed on the surfaces and located within the mesopores of the doped DMSNs. XPS and EDS analyses further supported the coexistence of Ce (III)/Ce(IV) and $\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{I}) / \mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{II})$ couples in $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ materials. The results of polishing tests towards $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ indicated that three type of DMSNs-involved abrasives enabled high-quality and defect-free surfaces with atomic-level finish ( $0.12-0.14 \mathrm{~nm}$ of $\mathrm{Ra}, 0.14-0.18 \mathrm{~nm}$ of $\mathrm{Rq})$. The low-modulus DMSNs carriers might be responsible for optimizing abrasive-surface interfacial contact and thus achieving soft polishing or soft abrasion. Upon UV irradiation-assisted PCMP, the synergy of $\mathrm{Cu}(\mathrm{I}) /$ Cu (II) and $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III}) / \mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{IV})$ couples was conducive to the ROS productions in photocatalysis and Fenton-like reactions, thus accelerating the formation of the chemically reacted layer (Si-OH structures). Furthermore, the incorporation of Ce (III) species contributed to promoting the material removal through the solid-state tribochemical reaction (the generation of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds). As a consequence, the material removal efficiencies followed the order of $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (PCMP, $184 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ) $>\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{Cu}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (CMP, $152 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min})>\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{DMSNs}$ (CMP, $93 \mathrm{~nm} /$ min ) $>$ DMSNs (CMP, $68 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ). The nano-scale impregnation of metal ions onto mesoporous silica has many advantages such as high elasticity and high chemical or photochemical and tribochemical activity for the development of novel abrasive systems. The presented methodology is highly promising for the synthesis of many other metal-doped meso- $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ materials that can find numerous applications in various fields.
