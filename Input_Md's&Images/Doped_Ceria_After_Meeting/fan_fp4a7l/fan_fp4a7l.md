#### Abstract

Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is a crucial step in integrated circuit manufacturing, and as chip feature sizes continue to shrink, there is an escalating demand for improved polishing performance. In this study, monodisperse porous $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanospheres were synthesized and then modified through Nd doping. The structural and chemical characterization confirmed the enrichment effect on surface defects ( $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancies) due to the doping, with the percentage of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$-Nd materials (39\%) being higher than that of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ (31\%). Furthermore, for the CMP application on silicon wafers, the material removal rate (MRR) of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ reached $126.3 \pm 17.5 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$, which is a $56 \%$ improvement over that of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$. In addition, the surface roughness (Ra) of the localized area $\left(3 \times 3 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)$ was reduced from initially $0.813 \pm 0.02 \mathrm{~nm}$ to $0.296 \pm 0.02 \mathrm{~nm}$ after polishing with $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$. The chemical bonding of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ is considered to be the bridge between the structural characteristics of the abrasive and the polishing properties, whose presence makes the CMP process more efficient and high-quality.


## 1. Introduction

The semiconductor industry is expected to revitalize from the cyclical downturn with the rise of artificial intelligence, mega data, and other emerging digital industries, which also drives the development of chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), one of the key technologies in integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing [1-3]. Polishing materials significantly affect the capacity and quality of downstream chips. Among them, abrasives are responsible for transmitting mechanical energy and modifying chemical surfaces, whose structural characteristics directly affect the results of CMP.
$\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, as one of the mainstream abrasives, has a superior crystal structure and excellent tribochemical activity [4], resulting in a strong affinity for $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$, which facilitates the efficient removal of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ by the "Chemical Tooth" effect [5]. Based on the concept that structure determines properties, the researchers designed $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based core-shell abrasives with non-rigid mechanical properties using a material with low elastic modulus as the core [6-10]. Furthermore, the polishing properties were improved by ion doping [11-14] and other forms of
energy were introduced to develop new CMP techniques, such as photochemical mechanical polishing (PCMP) [11,13,15-17], electrochemical mechanical polishing (ECMP) [7,18], and magnetic-field-assisted polishing [19]. Since the crystallization temperature of $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ is $450{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, which is higher than the decomposition temperature $\left(300{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ of polystyrene (PS), it is impossible to synthesize $\mathrm{PS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ directly on the foundation of $\mathrm{PS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. In response, Gao [20] improved the preparation process, in which the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ composite particles were synthesized and then coated on the surface of PS. Yet, the morphological diversity and non-spherical shape of as-produced abrasives may limit widespread application. Chen [21] replaced the inorganic photocatalyst $\left(\mathrm{TiO}_{2}\right)$ with the organic material polyaniline (PANI) to obtain PS/PANI/ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives. Not only addressed the preparation problem but also successfully constructed heterojunctions to achieve optimization of material removal rate by enhanced photocatalysis. Subsequently, they considered one material (carbon spheres, CS) to realize the actions of both PS and PANI components resulting in $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ core-shell abrasives [22]. The Carbon skeleton of CS provided additional charge transfer pathways, effectively extending the lifetime

of photogenerated charges for high-performance UV-assisted polishing. However, the synthesis procedure of core-shell abrasives is complicated and the shell layer is prone to breakage, causing serious contamination of the wafer surface. In this regard, Chen [23] directly synthesized cerium oxide abrasives with porous structure, which facilitate the polishing performance by optimizing interfacial contact behavior between abrasives and workpieces. Kim [24] synthesized ceria nanoparticles with different dopant concentrations of La and Nd, finding that the increase in electron density reduced the energy of oxygen vacancy formation when the low-oxidation state element replaces $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$.

In this work, monodisperse porous $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}\right)$ was synthesized by hydrothermal method and modified by Nd doping ( $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ ). It's well known that the preparation of abrasives is the first step to achieving the desired polishing results. Compared to previous reports on doping modification, this work provided abrasives with better morphology consistency and excellent monodispersity, then explored the effect of doping amount on morphology as well as the heat treatment process. On the other hand, we construct a more direct link between the structural characterization of the material synthesis ( $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}, \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$, etc.) and the mechanical/abrasive properties of the materials.

## 2. Materials and methods

### 2.1. Chemicals

The chemical reagents used in the experiments are as follows. Cerium nitrate $\left(\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \geq 98 \%\right)$, neodymium nitrate ( Nd $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \geq 98 \%$ ), and ethylene glycol were purchased from Shanghai MACKLIN Biochemical Co. Acetic acid $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}\right)$ was provided by Xilong Scientific Co., Ltd. All chemicals were used without any further purification.

### 2.2. Synthesis of abrasives

Monodisperse $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ mesoporous spheres were obtained via a reproducible and one-step synthetic strategy previously reported [25]. In a typical preparation, $1.5 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ was dissolved in 1.5 mL of Deionized water (DI) with 45 mL of ethylene glycol, and 1.5 mL of acetic acid $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}\right)$ was added dropwise. After thorough stirring, the mixture was transferred to a polytetrafluoroethylene liner, heated at $180^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 240 min , then cooled to room temperature. Subsequently, the resultant precipitates were centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 min , washed with DI and ethanol, and dried at $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 12 h to obtain $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ precursor.

For comparison, $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ precursors with varied Nd content were ready following a similar procedure as described above, with slight modifications. Identical to the previous synthesis except for the addition of Neodymium nitrate. Specifically, the doping amounts of $0.169,0.156$, 0.141 , and 0.127 . To investigate the impact of calcination temperature on the structural characteristics of abrasives, the above precursors were calcined at $300^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and $600^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in a muffle furnace for 2 h , respectively.

### 2.3. Polishing tests

Substrates to be polished were cut into rectangular pieces of ca. 20 mm in length and ca. 15 mm in width. The slurries were made with $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ treated by calcination at $600^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, at a concentration of $1.0 \mathrm{wt} \%$. moreover, a small amount of PVP ( $1.0 \mathrm{wt} \%$ ) as a dispersant, and the pH of slurry was maintained at 10 using NaOH . Prior to use, the slurries must be thoroughly mixed and ultrasonically treated for 30 min . Polishing tests were conducted on Bruker Universal Mechanical Tester (UMT TriboLab). For each experimental run, the head/pad rotational speed was $120 / 90 \mathrm{rpm}$, the polishing pressure was 8 N , and the slurry was delivered to the surface of the polishing pad by peristaltic pump at a flow rate of $100 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, and polishing time was 1 min . Subsequently,
the polished wafer was cleaned by sonication with DI, ethanol, and SC1 $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3} \cdot \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}: \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}: \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}=1: 1: 5\right)$ cleaning solution, then air-dried and stored at room temperature.
$\mathrm{MRR}=\frac{m_{0}-m}{\rho \cdot S \cdot t}$
The material removal rate (MRR, nm/min) was calculated by a weight-loss method as above [26], where wafer mass was weighed by ultra-precision electronic balance (XS105, Mettler Toledo, exact to 0.01 mg ). Herein, $m_{0}$ and $m(\mathrm{mg})$ are the masses before and after polishing, $\rho$ $\left(2.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\right)$ is the density of wafer, $S\left(\mathrm{~cm}^{2}\right)$ is the surface area of the polishing, and $t$ (s) is the polishing time. Furthermore, the polishing efficiency and roughness data provided are the averages of three runs with standard deviation.

The high-resolution surface morphologies of wafers before and after polishing were characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM, Nanoman VS, Bruker) with a scanning range of $3 \times 3 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ (256 pixels per line) in tapping mode. The recorded data were processed using the software (NanoScope Analysis) to determine the two-dimensional (2D)/three-dimensional (3D) images and the average roughness (Ra). In addition, for all AFM measurements, a commercial AFM probe (OLTESPA-R3) with a cantilever resonance frequency of 70 kHz , an elasticity factor of $2 \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{m}$, and a tip radius of curvature of 7 nm was applied.

### 2.4. Characterization

As-synthesized particles were observed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S4800) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010 EX). The crystal structures were characterized via powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, $\mathrm{Cu} \mathrm{K} \alpha, \lambda=1.4518 \AA$ ) over the $2 \theta$ ranging from $10^{\circ}$ to $90^{\circ}$. Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) was performed using Shimadzu UV-3600. The formation of oxygen vacancies was characterized using Raman spectroscopy (HORIBA T64000) in the test range of $400 \mathrm{~nm}-700 \mathrm{~nm}$. Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was obtained by PHI-5000 Versaprobe III spectrometer with Al K $\alpha$ radiation ( $\mathrm{h}_{\mathrm{r}}=1486.6 \mathrm{eV}$ ). Particle size distribution were examined by a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments, UK).

## 3. Results and discussion

### 3.1. Structure and morphology analyses

Firstly, the appearance and dispersion of the designed abrasives were determined by SEM as shown in Fig. 1. The $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ nanoabrasives obtained by hydrothermal method were monodisperse spheres with mixed particle sizes ( $80-180 \mathrm{~nm}$ ). Comparing the samples with different Nd doping, the abrasives with loading of 0.141 (Fig. 1 b) had the most ideal morphology with intact spherical particles, keeping the basic morphology of the virgin $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$. While excessive or insufficient quantities of doping had resulted in severe breakage of the nanospheres. Such abrasives may further fragment during polishing causing surface scratches, which significantly affect the polishing quality as well as pose a challenge to post-polishing cleaning. Therefore, $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ with a doping amount of 0.141 was selected for the subsequent research.

Subsequently, thermogravimetric tests (Fig. 2) were carried out to obtain a suitable range of calcination temperatures for the precursors. The weight loss in the low-temperature range (below $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) can be attributed to the removal of adsorbed water from porous $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, and in the range from $150^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ corresponds to the removal of hydroxyl groups from hydroxides (formation of oxides) and the decomposition of residual organic matter, where the decomposition temperature of ethylene glycol is $215^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Above $600^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ the weight loss curve tends to level off and the mass is unchanged. Given above, the precursors were

calcined at $300^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 400^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $600^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, respectively, to examine the dependency of calcination temperature on sample structure.

The above series of materials were characterised by XRD to find the optimal calcination process. In Fig. 3, the peaks located at ca. $28.6^{\circ}$, $33.1^{\circ}, 47.0^{\circ}$, and $56.3^{\circ}$ can be indexed to lattice planes of (111), (200),
(220), (311), and (331) reflections of cubic fluorite-type $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (JCPDS No. 34-0394) [27]. As calcination temperature increases, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ decreased and the peaks got sharper, implying superior crystallinity. According to Bragg's equation and the Scherrer formula [28], the calculated data based on the (111) XRD diffractions were shown in Table 1. Compared to $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$, the interplanar spacing of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ obtained at the same calcination temperature was all increased. In particular, the interplanar spacing of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ calcined at $600{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ was $3.126 \AA$, which was slightly larger than that of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ $(3.122 \AA$ ). The ionic radius of $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ is about 99.5 pm compared to 92.0 pm for $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, hence lattice expansion was expected due to the incorporation of $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ [24,29]. Moreover, $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ nanocrystal sizes calculated from the Scherrer formula were 6.318 nm and 6.496 nm ,

respectively. To sum up, the samples calcined at $600{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with optimum crystallinity were finally selected for subsequent characterization.
$2 d \sin \theta=n \lambda$
$D=K \lambda /(\beta \cos \theta)$
Here, $d$ is interplanar spacing, $\theta$ is the angle between the incident X-rays and the corresponding crystal plane, $\lambda$ is the X-ray wavelength ( $\lambda=$ 0.15406 nm ), $n$ is the number of diffraction levels, $D$ is average grain size, $\beta$ is FWHM, and $K$ is a constant related to crystal shape, taken as 0.89 in this work [30].

Following the discussion of the doping amount and the calcination process, the internal structure of the screened abrasive was observed by TEM and EDS to recognize whether it meets the design. As seen in Fig. 4, the porous materials were stacked by $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles with a size of about 5 nm , hence revealing irregular pore structures inside abrasives. In contrast to $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$, the doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles appeared denser, causing the pore size narrower in $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$. In the high-resolution TEM, clear and uniform $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice stripes were observed, and (111) interplanar spacing expanded from 0.323 nm to 0.375 nm after modification, signifying the expansion of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice, which is consistent with the XRD analysis. EDS-Mapping analysis can visually reflect the element distribution on the spherical abrasives. Fig. 4 (c) revealed that elements of $\mathrm{Ce}, \mathrm{O}$, and Nd were uniformly distributed on the $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ nanospheres, which also revealed the successful doping of Nd ions.

Later, the porous structure of the abrasive was confirmed by the nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms in Fig. 5. The specific surface areas of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ were $143.5 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ and $98.49 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$. Based on the adsorption-branching data, the average pore sizes of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ were 5.665 nm and 1.927 nm , respectively, according to the Barrett-Joiner-Halenda (BJH) calculations. The doping modification resulted in a denser structure of the porous abrasive, which is consistent with the TEM results.

Once the basic structure of the synthesized material has been clari-
fied, it is necessary to characterize the surface defects of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles induced by doping. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the proposed products were shown in Fig. 6, the distinct peaks located at $250-350 \mathrm{~nm}$ possibly revealed the electron transition from O 2 p to $\mathrm{Ce} 4 \mathrm{f}$ orbital. The absorption edges of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$. were ca. 403 nm and 415 nm , respectively. In other words, a pronounced redshift (shift to higher wavelengths) can be detected for the $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$, which may be owing to the lattice defects caused by Nd-doping. Considering the band gap energy $\left(E_{\mathrm{g}}\right)$ of abrasives, the Schuster-Kubelka-Munk [31] absorption function ( $a \hbar v$ ) versus the photon energy ( $\hbar v$ ) was plotted according to Eq. (4).
$\left(a \hbar v\right)^{n}=A\left(\hbar v-E_{z}\right)$
Here, $a$ is the absorption coefficient, $\hbar v$ is the photon energy, $A$ is the proportionality constant, and $n$ is taken as $2\left(\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\right.$ is a direct gap semiconductor). The results were shown in Fig. 6 (b), and the approximate band gap can be identified from the horizontal axis intercept. For $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$, the $E_{\mathrm{g}}$ were 3.28 eV and 3.16 eV , respectively. The narrowed band gap could be explained by the formation of doping transition states, derived from the increase in surface defects, which imply that the $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ possesses high $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $V_{\mathrm{O}}$ concentrations compared to the $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$. Subsequently, Raman and XPS were applied for further identification of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surface defects.

Moreover, Raman spectrum is a nondestructive technique applied to detect oxygen vacancy defects in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. In Fig. 7, the strong peaks at ca. $460 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ can be ascribed to the typical Raman vibration mode $\left(F_{2 g}\right)$ of the cubic fluorite-type $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials [22]. In addition, the weak peak at $600 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ was also assigned to structural defects of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (typically $V_{\mathrm{O}}$ ) resulting from doping modification [32]. Hence, the peak intensity ratio of the band at $600 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ to $460 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\left(I_{600} / I_{460}\right)$ could reflect the concentration of $V_{\mathrm{O}}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ [23,33]. The calculated $I_{600} / I_{460}$ value for $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ (ca. 0.10) was higher than that of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ (ca. 0.04), a preliminary indication of the increase in $V_{\mathrm{O}}$ concentration after Nd doping.

To accurately identify the surface chemical composition and

elemental valence states of the materials, $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ abrasives were analyzed by XPS spectroscopy. As seen in Fig. 8 (b), the peaks at ca. 982.3 eV and 1005.8 eV for $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$, corresponding to $\mathrm{Nd} 3 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}$ and $\mathrm{Nd} 3 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}$, respectively, proved the successful doping of $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ ions. Fig. 9 (c) depicted the Ce 3d core level and two group peaks (denoted as $v$ and $u$ ) obtained after deconvolution treatment, which suggests both valences $\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right.$ and $\left.\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}\right)$ are present in abrasives. Furthermore, the
ratio of the valence states of cerium can be determined semiquantitatively using the combined peak areas of the respective valence states. The results obtained according to Eqs. (5)-(7) [22,33] were summarized in Table 2, where C and A represent concentration and area. The $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ for $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ was calculated to be $39 \%$, while the value was only $31 \%$ in $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$, indicating that Nd doping contributes to the increase of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ proportion on the surface of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$.

Besides, the density of oxygen vacancy in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives can be inferred from the O 1s spectra, which are deconvoluted into three peaks, as illustrated in Fig. 9 (d). Peaks at about 529 eV, 531 eV , and 533 eV belonged to lattice oxygen (O $\alpha$ ), surface oxygen (O $\beta$ ), and adsorbed oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{T}\right)$, respectively. Where O $\alpha$ represents the $\mathrm{O}^{2-}$ ion in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice, $\mathrm{O} \beta\left(\mathrm{O}^{2-}, \mathrm{O}_{2}^{2-}\right.$ or $\left.\mathrm{O}^{-}\right)$implies the existence of $V_{\mathrm{O}}$ in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ substrate, and $\mathrm{O}_{T}$ are other weakly bound oxygen species, such as carbonate $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}\right)$, adsorbed molecular water and hydroxyl $\left(\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right)[34]$. The density of $V_{\mathrm{O}}$ can be calculated by the relation $\mathrm{O} \beta /\left(\mathrm{O} \alpha+\mathrm{O} \beta+\mathrm{O}_{T}\right)$ based on their peak areas, which ratio is $43.9 \%$ for $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ and $58.3 \%$ for $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ (more oxygen vacancies), such trend is consistent with the Raman analysis.

In summary, Raman and XPS analyses directly evidenced the formation of $V_{\mathrm{O}}$ and the conversion of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ due to Nd doping, which also provided a convincing basis for the apparent connection between the structural characterization $\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}, V_{\mathrm{O}}\right.$, etc.) and the CMP performance of abrasives.

### 3.2. CMP performances

So far, the basic structure and surface defects of the abrasive have been identified, prior to polishing, the dispersion of the abrasive in the slurry needs to be considered. The results of particle size distribution based on the dynamic light scattering (DLS) method are shown in Fig. 9, the size of the abrasive is almost uniform, with an average size of 194 nm for $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ and $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ of 157 nm , respectively, and there is no serious agglomeration.

Subsequently, we applied these highly dispersible polishing slurries to polishing tests. The 2D/3D morphology and surface roughness of the wafer surface were characterized by AFM. Fig. 10 (a) presented the wafer surface before polishing, which showed a non-uniform color distribution in 2D-AFM, and the 3D-AFM also clearly reflected a large number of nanoscale roughness peaks, which implies a relatively rough original surface. Besides, the Rain the range of $3 \times 3 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ was as high as $0.813 \pm 0.02 \mathrm{~nm}$. Fig. 10 (b-c) illustrated the results after polishing by $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$. Compared with the original surface, most of the nano-sized rough peaks in 3D-AFM have been removed, and the surface

flatness of the wafer significantly improved. Especially, the Ra of the wafer surface was reduced to $0.296 \pm 0.02 \mathrm{~nm}$ after polishing by $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$, with the obtained MRR, another key evaluation index for polishing
performance, reaching $80.8 \pm 8.7 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$. In the case of the dopedmodified abrasive, the MRR was further increased to $126.3 \pm 17.5$ $\mathrm{nm} / \mathrm{min}$, an improvement of nearly $56 \%$. However, the quality of the

polishing was not satisfactory, and the surface roughness was reduced only to $0.542 \pm 0.03 \mathrm{~nm}$. In response to the above results (Table 3), Firstly, MRR and surface roughness are a pair of contradictions, implying that the increase of MRR will cause a decrease of polishing quality to a certain extent. That is why adjusting the factors to realize the balance between them is a priority issue in the future. Secondly, compared to $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$, the size of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ is reduced, possessing a larger surface area, and an increased proportion of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, contributing to a higher surface density of -OH groups through $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ dissociation, which may further lead to more $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonding. On the one hand, it can improve the MRR, nonetheless, making it challenging to remove ceria particles from the oxide surface after the CMP process. The residual abrasives will seriously affect the surface flatness, which is manifested in the rise of the roughness.

In conclusion, the porous cerium oxide abrasive is capable of CMP flattening, further research is still desired to optimize the abrasive properties, slurry formulation, and polishing process to obtain a higherquality surface.

In order to ensure the designed porous abrasive will not break under the current polishing pressure, which will affect the polishing effect and post-cleaning, the polishing waste slurry was analyzed by SEM (see Fig. 11), revealing no significant change in abrasive morphology and particle size after use, affirming that the synthesized abrasive which possessed excellent structural stability.

### 3.3. CMP mechanism analysis

As stated above, the excellent morphology and high dispersion of the designed abrasive were verified by SEM and TEM, as well as the surface defects of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles were demonstrated by Raman, XPS, and DRS, finally, relatively improved polishing results were obtained in the CMP of wafers. Combined with previous reports, the bridge between the structural characteristics of the abrasive and the mechanical/abrasive properties is considered to be the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ chemical bonding. The surface defects of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles (especially $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ) facilitate the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ at the interface between the abrasive and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ wafers, and the mechanism of material removal of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ is essentially related to the dynamic formation and breakage of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds [11,35,36], whose presence makes the CMP process more productive and high-quality.

As early as 2001, Hoshino [37] discussed the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ between abrasive and substrate by FT-IR-ATR. There are two peaks near 1100 cm , which are split into two peaks from one peak by polarised light, belonging to the asymmetric stretching mode. The splitting width was changed by polishing, indicating that the surface was modified by $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. Inspired by this method, the surface of the wafer before and after polishing was analyzed, shown in Fig. 12, and the two peaks mentioned above do move after polishing, which is most likely due to the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$. In addition, Miyamoto [38] applied the tight-binding quantum chemical molecular dynamics method to the investigations on the mechano-chemical reaction dynamics during the CMP process of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surface by $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles, suggesting that mechanical forces introduced by $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles accelerate the chemical reactions at the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ interface, forming new $\mathrm{Si}_{\mathrm{SiO} 2}-\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{CeO} 2}$. Han [39] explored the adhesion mechanisms of ceria to the oxide surface, hypothesizing that chemical bonding of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ dominates under polishing conditions, leading to higher contamination at higher pH . Later, the strong additional peaks associated with $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonding were detected in the O 1 s

XPS spectra at binding energies of about 532 eV for surfaces polished at pH 8 , validating the presence of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonding. Kim [24] confirmed the improved reactivities of the particles by doping by measuring the reduction of the work function of the doped ceria nanoparticles and the increase in the adhesion force with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$.

In this work, the possible polishing mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 13. In the weakly alkaline polishing slurry, $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ is chemically etched to form a surface soft layer prone to be removed, and numerous $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}$ sites are generated on the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surface. Alternatively, the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ on the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surface can react with water to form surface hydroxyl groups, which in turn react with the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}$ sites to form $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds (Reaction 8). Subsequently, the comparatively weak $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds break under the mechanical action of the abrasives and polishing pad, allowing the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ soft layer to be removed in the form of lumps, which is the "lump removal model" proposed by Hoshino [37]. Furthermore, porous nanoparticles can effectively optimize the contact pattern between the abrasive and the wafer to reduce scratch damage [33], while increased contact area also benefits the polishing rate.
$\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{SiO}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}$
Since surface defects such as $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives could facilitate the frictional chemical activity and chemical bonding between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{SiO}_{2}[13,14]$, which accelerates the formation and breakage of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds and ultimately improves the material removal rate of CMP. Compared to undoped abrasives, the nearly $56 \%$ increase in the polishing rate of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ can be attributed to the formation of doped transition states as demonstrated by DRS, which is essentially an enrichment effect of the doping modification on $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surface defects

[23]. As shown in Fig. 13 (a), the surface-exposed $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ is replaced by $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$, and to achieve the electric equilibrium of the crystal, part of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ is converted to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ [13], which is accompanied by the formation of oxygen vacancies. Since lattice contraction due to the oxygen vacancies can be compensated by lattice expansion induced by ionic doping, the system also achieves stress balance. In summary, Nd doping can increase the number of defects on the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surface to achieve charge and stress balance [40], and increased surface defects ultimately enhance polishing performance according to the polishing mechanism described above.

## 4. Conclusion

Porous cerium oxide nanospheres $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ with a particle size of $80-180 \mathrm{~nm}$ were synthesized by a hydrothermal method, which possesses excellent topographic consistency and excellent dispersibility. Subsequently, ionic doping and heat treatment processes were investigated, in which abrasives with doping amounts of 0.141 and calcination at $600{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ showed optimal sphericity and crystallinity. Raman spectra demonstrated ratios of $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{600}} / \mathrm{I}_{860}$ for $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ are 0.04 and 0.10 , respectively, XPS indicated the proportion of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in the $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ material was $39 \%$, higher than that of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}(31 \%)$, implying an increase in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ due to doping. The chemical bonding of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ is considered to be the bridge between the structural characteristics of the abrasive and the mechanical/wear resistance properties, whose presence makes the CMP process more efficient and high-quality. Therefore, the MRR of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Nd}$ was increased by nearly $56 \%$ compared to that of $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$, reaching $126.3 \pm 17.5 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$. The enhanced polishing rate may be associated with the increased surface defects and frictional chemical activity of doped abrasives. And the wafer roughness can be reduced from 0.813 nm to 0.296 nm after polishing with $\mathrm{pCeO}_{2}$. This work identifies suitable doping and calcination processes and provides a practical program for the preparation and modification of porous $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$
abrasives.
