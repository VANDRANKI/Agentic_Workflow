A series of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{M}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives with different types and amounts of doping were prepared by molten salt method. The properties of abrasives were characterized in detail by XRD, SEM, EDS and XPS. For all doping types, the morphology of abrasives changes from spherical to octahedral and their size decreases continuously with the doping increases. The $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration on the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive surface is also increased by doping. The density functional theory indicates the vacancy formation energy of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems are reduced by doping. The mechanism of transition from $\mathrm{Ge}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ induced in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ system by doping is also discussed. CMP experiments show that the efficiency of the abrasives is significantly enhanced by doping. The MRR of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}, \mathrm{La}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives increased by $56 \%, 40 \%$ and $44 \%$ compared with the pure. It is also shown that the appropriate amount $(x=0.08)$ should be considered in order to obtain excellent performance. It is confirmed that the substrate surface with almost no damage and low roughness is obtained after polishing. The removal mechanism of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives on $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate is comprehensively analyzed by considering the size, morphology and defects of the abrasives.

## 1. Introduction

Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) [1-4] is the flattening technique that takes into account both local and global aspects of materials, which achieves the microscale removal of materials through the synergy of surface chemical reactions and mechanical grinding [5]. CMP is known as a "black box" technology, a large number of practical experience has shown that the slurry and the abrasives in it are the key factors affecting the CMP performance [6]. In particular, the key $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives are widely used for CMP processing in the industries of optical lens and semiconductor [7]. The micromorphology, particle size, mechanical properties, crystal structure and defects of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives are considered to have direct impacts on the removal rate and surface quality of materials [8]. Kim et al. [9] believed that abrasives with sharp edges have a better polishing performance than those with spherical on the initial surface with large bumps and depressions. Based on the
contact area model, Yang et al. [10] found that spherical $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives with smaller size had better removal result on serrated edges due to the increase of the total contact area with the substrate. From the perspective of mechanical contact between the abrasives and the substrate, a number of researchers also designed a serious of core/shell structure composite abrasives. Chen et al. [11-13] designed $\mathrm{PS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{PMMA} /$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ composite abrasives. It is believed that the spring effect of organic core can effectively adjust the contact state between the abrasives and the workpiece, which reduces the damage of the hard abrasives to the materials. Peedikakkandy et al. [14] designed $\mathrm{SiO}_{2} /$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ composite abrasives with stable structure and found that it had good selectivity for the polishing between $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Si}_{3} \mathrm{~N}_{4}$ substrates. However, the MRR of the abrasives is generally low, and the shell is prone to structural and functional failure under the load, which limits its application in the semiconductor industry where linewidth requirements are getting smaller and smaller.

The evolution of integrated circuit technology has brought a rapid growth in the demand for polishing materials, which requires the improvement of polishing efficiency. Sabia and Stevens [15] found that there is not only $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ but also a certain amount of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ on the surface of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives during the polishing. Seo et al. [16] confirmed that the polishing efficiency of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives is enhanced by improving its proportion of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. Schmitt et al. [17] considered that the doping of trivalent ions is more favorable than others for the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ on $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystals. Patil et al. [18] also found that the doping of trivalent ions would generate a large number of oxygen vacancies, but it would not have a significant effect on the structure of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystal. Cheng et al. [19] doped lanthanides (La, Nd, Yb) into the surface of commercial $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives, and the polishing efficiency of the abrasives on the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate was significantly improved. Kim et al. [20] also reported that the MRR of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives with high concentration $\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ doping was improved by 3.62 times compared with the pure groups. Generally, the improvement of CMP performance by the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ on $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives has been experimentally verified, and the abrasives have been modified by doping. However, the effects of different types and amounts of doping on crystal structure, micromorphology and defects of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives need to be further understood. The complexity and the mechanism of defect formation have not been elucidated in detail. Furthermore, the influence of a series of changes in abrasives caused by doping on CMP performance has not been comprehensively analyzed.

In this work, a series of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{M}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives with different types (M $=\mathrm{Y}, \mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Pr}$ ) and amounts ( $x=0.00,0.02,0.04,0.06,0.08,0.10$ ) of doping were prepared by a simple molten salt method. The effects of different types and amounts of doping on the crystal structure, micromorphology and defects of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives were investigated. The defects in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystal are analyzed by theoretical calculation and experimental characterization, and the mechanism of the transformation from $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ induced by doping is explained. In addition, the influence of the change of particle size, morphology and defects of the abrasives caused by doping on the CMP performance is discussed. And the CMP mechanism of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives is also discussed in detail. To the best of our knowledge, a detailed explanation of the effect of doping on the properties of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives and its CMP performance on $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrates has not been reported so far.

## 2. Experiment

### 2.1. Chemicals and reagents

Cerium nitrate hexahydrate $\left(\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$, Lanthanum nitrate hydrate $\left(\mathrm{La}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot \mathrm{nH}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$, Praseodymium nitrate hydrate (Pr $\left.\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$, Yttrium nitrate hexahydrate $\left(\mathrm{Y}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$ ), Potassium Chloride (KCl), Sodium chloride ( NaCl ) are all analytical reagent, they are all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). Analytical reagent ethanol is purchased from Tianjin Fuyu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. (China). Homemade deionized water is used throughout the experiment. All chemicals are used without further purification.

### 2.2. Preparation of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{M}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives

A series of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{M}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{M}=\mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Pr}, \mathrm{Y} ; x=0.00,0.02,0.04,0.06,0.08$, 0.10) abrasives were prepared by a simple molten salt method. A typical synthesis [21] is described as follows: high-purity cerium nitrate, lanthanum nitrate, praseodymium nitrate and yttrium nitrate were used as precursors for the preparation of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{M}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ particles. Firstly, according to the stoichiometric weights, the precursor was weighed in a total molar amount of 5 mmol , and the KCl - NaCl eutectic salt (a molar ratio of 1:1, the eutectic point was $657^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) was weighed in a molar ratio of 1:10. Next, the precursor and eutectic salt were ground separately and the raw materials were mixed in absolute ethanol. The mixture was transferred to an alumina porcelain boat and dried in an oven at $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

Then, it was calcined in a muffle furnace with a certain temperature regime to obtain a mixture containing $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles. Finally, the impurity salts in the mixture were washed away with hot deionized water to obtain high-purity $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{M}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ particles.

### 2.3. Characterization of the abrasives

The phase and crystal structure of all abrasives was analyzed using Xray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance, Bruker, Germany) with Cu K $\alpha$ radiation ( $\lambda=0.15418 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) from $20^{\circ}$ to $80^{\circ}$ at a rate of $0.02^{\circ} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The micromorphology and elemental distribution of the abrasives were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Apreso S, FEI, USA) equipped with an energy dispersive spectrometers (EDS). The chemical states of elements were analyzed by an X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, Thermo Scientific K-Alpha, USA) with a monochromated Al K $\alpha$ source, and the pass energy was set to be 100.0 eV for the survey scan and 50.0 eV for the fine scan. The binding energy was calibrated using the adsorbed carbon ( $284.8 \mathrm{eV})$ as the energy standard.

### 2.4. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation

All structural relaxation and total energy calculations were performed with the density functional theory (DFT) method [22], as implemented in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) [23], [24]. The projector augmented wave (PAW) method was utilized to describe the electron-ion interaction. The exchange-correlation interaction functional is the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional [22], [25] and the electron wave functions are expanded using the plane waves with an energy cutoff of 500 eV [19]. In this calculation, the U parameter applied to the $\mathrm{Ce} 4 \mathrm{f}$ and O 2 p states were set to 5 and 5.5 eV , respectively [19], [26]. The convergence of total energy and the force between atoms were set to $10^{-5}$ eV and $0.01 \mathrm{eV} \cdot \AA^{-1}$, respectively. The G-centered Monkhorst-Pack kmesh with a size of $2 \times 2 \times 2$ was applied [19]. All atomic positions were fully relaxed by using of conjugate gradient algorithm.

### 2.5. CMP experiment

These CMP slurries were simply prepared for polishing tests. The abrasives was dispersed by ball milling, the solid content of the slurries was adjusted to $0.5 \mathrm{wt} \%$, and the pH of the slurries was adjusted to 6.0 using low-concentration ammonia and nitric acid solution. All slurries were homogenized using a magnetic stirrer before the CMP test. The quartz glass with a nominal diameter of 20 mm and a thickness of 2 mm purchased from Lianyungang Xiongtai Quartz Technology Co., Ltd. (China) was used as the material to be polished. The CMP experiments were performed on UNIPOL-1200S automatic pressure grinding and polishing machine (Shenyang Kejing Auto-instrument, Co. LTD, China) equipped with synthetic leather polishing pad (Shenyang Kejing Autoinstrument, Co. LTD, China). Then the detailed polishing parameters are described as follows: the rotation speed of the platen and the carrier were both $80 \mathrm{r} / \mathrm{min}$, the self-rotation direction was opposite, the applied polishing load was 3.5 kg , the polishing time was 3 min , and the slurry supplying rate was $25 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$.

The polished samples were repeatedly cleaned by ultrasonic waves in deionized water, and CMP performance was characterized after the glass was dried. Surface defects and roughness of the substrate were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Seiko SPA400-SP13800N, Japan) equipped with a silicon nitride tip, which was scanned over a $5 \mu \mathrm{~m} \times 5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ area in contact mode at a rate of 1.0 Hz . In the evaluation of polishing efficiency, a precision electronic balance with an accuracy of 0.1 mg was used to measure the weight of the polished workpiece. The MRR was obtained by indirect calculation through Eq. (1) [27], [28].
$M R R=\frac{m_{0}-m}{\rho \times S \times t}$

where $m_{0}$ and m are the mass of the quartz substrate before and after polishing, respectively, $\rho$ is the nominal density of commercial quartz glass $\left(2.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\right), S$ is the area of the substrate ( $\mathrm{x} \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ ), and $t$ is the polishing time ( 3 min ). In the CMP test, all MRR and roughness data presented are based on the average of three replicated experiments.

## 3. Results and discussion

### 3.1. Phase analysis

The XRD pattern of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives ( $x=0.00,0.02,0.04,0.06$, $0.08,0.10$ ) is shown in Fig. S1. The diffraction peaks appear at 20 about $28.5^{\circ}, 33.1^{\circ}, 47.5^{\circ}, 56.3^{\circ}, 59.1^{\circ}, 69.4^{\circ}, 76.7^{\circ}$ and $79.1^{\circ}$, which are attributed to the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331) and (420) planes of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ phase (PDF\#34-0394) with cubic fluorite structure, respectively. Moreover, no other impurity phases ( $\mathrm{Y}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$, etc.) were identified with the increase of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doping, which indicates the formation of Ce-Y-O solid solution in all samples. It is also noted that the peak position shifts to a lower angle with the increase of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doping. The lattice expansion of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ results in a shift in the trend of the peaks [29], which is attributed to the fact that the radius of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}(90 \mathrm{pm})$ is larger than that of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}(87 \mathrm{pm})$. The XRD patterns of a series of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{La}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives prepared also showed a similar trend, as shown in Fig. S1(a) and Fig. S2 (a). Differently, the deviation degree and full width at half maxima (FWHM) of the peaks are controlled by ion radius.

The influence of doping on $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ phase was analyzed by GSAS program, the Rietveld refinement results based on the XRD patterns of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples are shown in Fig. 1. The red circle represents the recorded, the black line marks the calculated, and the blue line shows the different profiles for the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ powder in the Figs. All the refinements were running to low refinement parameters $\left(R_{\mathrm{p}}<6 \%, R_{\mathrm{mp}}<8 \%, \mathrm{Ch} i^{2}\right.$ $<2$ ), which ensures that the result are credible. Table 1 shows the Rietveld refinement results of lattice parameters and unit cell volume of the $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples. The results show that the lattice constant and cell volume of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystal are continuously increased with the incorporation of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$, which is consistent with the results of the XRD patterns.

| $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ | $5.4133(18)$ | $158.6(32)$ |

### 3.2. Characterization of morphology

The morphology and size are two crucial parameters of abrasives for CMP applications. Fig. 2, Figs.S2(b)-(f) and Figs. S3(b)-(f) show the SEM images of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{La}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 2 (a) that pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives are spherical particles with an average size of $\sim 238.10 \mathrm{~nm}$. However, this situation is changed by $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doping. On the one hand, the size of abrasives is significantly reduced with the increase of doping. On the other hand, the morphology of abrasives changes to octahedron with the incorporation of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$. In addition, as shown in Figs.S2(b)-(f) and Figs. S3(b)-(f), the change of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{La}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives is more significant with doping. Fig. S4 summarizes the average size of the $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{M}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives, which shows that the particle size is affected by the types and amounts of doping. In the same amount, the incorporation of ions with larger radius is more likely to lead to the reduction of particle size. In the same type, the more doping, the smaller the particle size. Fig. S5 shows EDS mapping images of pure and $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doped, $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ doped and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives with a doping amount of 0.10 . All known elements of the samples were identified and no other irrelevant elements were detected. And the distribution of all elements is consistent with the dispersion of the samples, which also reflects the formation of the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{M}-\mathrm{O}$ solid solution [30]. In addition, the EDS spectra corresponding to pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{La}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{La}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{La}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples are shown in Fig. 3 (a)-(d). It is observed that the elements in the corresponding spectra of all samples are present in nearly stoichiometric ratio. The atomic ratios of Y , La and Pr atoms in the samples are $2.05,1.11$ and $1.62 \mathrm{at} \%$,

respectively, which also reflects that ions with smaller radii are more likely to be incorporated.

### 3.3. DFT analysis

The electronic structure of the ideal $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystal is calculated in order to analyze the effect of doping on the electronic structure of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ phase. Fig. S6 (a) shows the calculated spin up electron density of state (DOS) of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ structure. In this work, the DOS near the Fermi level is analyzed, which mainly reflects the electronic properties of the system. The electron states near the Fermi level are divided into two regions, which are the valence band of $-5-0 \mathrm{eV}$ and the conduction band of 0 - 5 eV [31]. The electron states in the valence region are mainly composed of $\mathrm{O} 2 \mathrm{p}, \mathrm{Ce} 5 \mathrm{~d}$ and Ce 4 f orbitals, which correspond to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The electron states in the conduction region are mainly composed of empty Ce 4 f orbitals without electrons, which corresponds to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) [32]. The calculated band gap width of O 2 p state is
about 4.0 eV , and the band gap between $\mathrm{O} 2 \mathrm{p}$ and Ce 4 f state is about 2.3 eV , which is consistent with the results in the report [26]. According to the energy band theory of solids, the prerequisite for a good conductor is that the Fermi energy level intersects one or more energy bands and the band is wide. It can be seen from Fig. S6(a) that $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ does not meet the condition, which also indicates that $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is a weakly conductive material. In addition, the band gap of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is large, the covalent bond is strong, and the ionic bond is weak, which is the reason for its weak electrical conductivity. Fig. 3 also pointed out that there are empty f orbitals near the Fermi level of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, which makes it easy for electrons to be stored in them [17]. This also explains the fundamental reason for the unique performance of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials from a microscopic perspective. Figs. S6(b) shows the XRD patterns of pure and the doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ by simulation. The peak of the doped sample shifts to a lower angle, which is consistent with the experimental results.

Fig. 4 shows the DOS of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ system including dopants and oxygen vacancy. The red curves describe the DOS of the unreduced systems in the Figs. Different from pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, it can be seen that a hole state in its O

$2 p$ state at the top of the valence band in the doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ system, which is attributed to the +4 -valent Ce is replaced by the +3 -valent impurity. The electrons left by the formation of oxygen vacancies are accepted by the O 2 p state, which results in the reduction of oxygen vacancy formation energy. The blue curves represent the DOS of the reduced systems, the DOS of the reduced systems moves towards the lower energy level compared with the unreduced systems, which is caused by the generation of oxygen vacancies. After the system is reduced, a new gap state appears near the Fermi level, which is consistent with other studies [33], [34]. The gap state is mainly from the Ce 4 f state, which indicates that the Ce 4 f orbital is partially occupied by two electron generated after the formation of the oxygen vacancy. And the electron of Ce 4 f state is localized on the Ce ion around the oxygen vacancy, which will promote the two neighboring $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ reduction to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$.

The electronic structure of the reduced systems are significantly changed compared with the unreduced systems. Therefore, the vacancy formation energy of doped and undoped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems were studied. The oxygen vacancy formation energies ( $E_{\text {vac }}$ ) are calculated using Eq. (2) [35].
$E_{\text {vac }}=E_{\text {cell-vac }}+1 / 2 E\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)-E_{\text {cell }}$
where $E_{\text {cell-vac }}$ and $E_{\text {cell }}$ are the total energy of the supercell with and without an oxygen vacancy, respectively, and $E\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ represents the total energy of the ground state of a free $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecule. The positive $E_{\text {vac }}$ values indicate that the formation of the O vacancy requires the provision of additional energy. The calculated energy values are shown in Table 2, the $E_{\text {vac }}$ required for the generation of each oxygen vacancy in pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$
is $3.4985 \mathrm{eV}$, which is similar to the other results. And the $E_{\text {vac }}$ of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{La}^{3+}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ are $0.8517,1.0228$ and 1.0028 eV , respectively. The $E_{\text {vac }}$ of all doping $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems is significantly reduced compared with the pure, which indicate $\mathrm{M}^{3+}$ doping is very favorable to the formation of oxygen vacancy. The oxygen vacancy is closely related to the transition from $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, and the reduction of the $E_{\text {vac }}$ greatly promotes the generation of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}[36]$.

Furthermore, the repulsion between positive charges in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice is reduced by $\mathrm{M}^{3+}$ doping, which reduces the energy of the systems. However, the Table 2 shows that the cell energy is increased after the $\mathrm{M}^{3+}$ doping. The reason is that the lattice constant is increased caused by doping, which enhances the residual stress generated in the crystallization of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ phase [17]. Therefore, a large amount of $\mathrm{M}^{3+}$ doping is not conducive to the stability of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ phase.

### 3.4. XPS analysis

The elemental composition of the actual sample and the corresponding Ce element valence information were characterized by XPS technology. Fig. 5(a) shows the XPS survey spectra of the samples. The peaks of Ce and O elements are calibrated in all the spectra. The specific peaks of $\mathrm{Y}, \mathrm{La}$ and Pr elements were only identified in $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{La}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples, respectively, which also support the EDS results. Fig. 5(b)-(e) show the Ce 3d fine spectra of the samples. The Ce 3d level is composed of two pairs of spin orbital doublet of $3 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}$ and $3 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}$ [36]. The peaks attributed to the Ce 3d core level is formed by fluctuations in the electronic states of the Ce 4 f level, which reflect the changes between $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$. Therefore, the Ce 3d spectra were

further analyzed by the nonlinear peak fitting method. The peaks of the spin orbits $3 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}$ and $3 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}$ are labeled with $u$ and $v$, respectively. And the peaks labeled $v, v^{\prime \prime}, v^{\prime \prime \prime}, u, u^{\prime \prime}$, and $u^{\prime \prime \prime}$ belong to the peaks of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, and the peaks labeled $v_{0}, v^{\prime}, u_{0}$, and $u^{\prime}$ represent $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ [37].

Fig. 5(f) shows the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration of the abrasive surfaces. The $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration of the pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives is $21.81 \%$, and the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration is significantly improved by doping. Specifically, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration on the surface of $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Y}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{La}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.9} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.1} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives are $37.03,30.96$ and $32.85 \%$, respectively. The results are consistent with the $E_{\text {vac }}$ calculated by DFT. The oxygen vacancy formation energy in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystals is reduced by doping, which significantly promotes the transition from $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. The abundant $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives is crucial for the improvement of CMP performance [8]. The mechanism of Ce valence transition induced by $\mathrm{M}^{3+}$ doping is analyzed in the next section.

### 3.5. Formation mechanism of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ induced by ion doping

The free electrons generated in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ system are easily stored due to the presence of Ce 4 f orbitals [17], which is also the reason for the
transition of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. As previously calculated by the DFT, the generation of intrinsic oxygen vacancies is difficult due to the high energy required, which greatly restricts the transition of Ce valence. The $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ system can obtain the benefit of high oxygen vacancy concentration at the cost of only low impurity introduction by doping. Fig. 6 shows the schematic diagram of the structural evolution of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystal after doping. The trivalent $\mathrm{M}^{3+}$ is incorporated into the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice, which replaces the high valence $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$. In order to maintain the charge balance inside the lattice, the lattice oxygen is diffused to the outside in the way of Eq. (4), while oxygen vacancies are generated in the lattice, as shown in Eq. (5). In addition, the overflow of molecular oxygen releases two free electrons in its vacancy to maintain electrical neutrality, as shown as Eq. (6) and Fig. 6(a). Meanwhile, the positive ions around the oxygen vacancy obtain the electrons, which results in the reduction of the Ce valence, as shown in Eq. (7) [18]. It's worth noting that the electrons don't permanently bind to a certain $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to bring its valence down to + 3. That is, the electron doesn't belong to a certain $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, but moves around the vacancy under the control of the electric field, which makes it easy for the electron to migrate from one $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ site to another. Fig. 6(b) shows the ideal evolution behavior. At a certain moment, an electron

attaches to a nearby $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, which temporarily gains this electron and becomes $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, and at another moment, this electron combines with another $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$.

### 3.6. Material removal rate (MRR)

The relentless pursuit of the MRR not only optimizes manufacturing time, but also saves the cost of the slurry. Fig. 7 shows the MRR of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrates polished with the slurries containing pure, $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doped, $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ doped and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ doped abrasives. The MRR of pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives is 401.90 nm . The MRRs of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives with different amounts of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doping are $509.10,578.74,589.46,626.97$ and $562.67 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$, respectively. This illustrates that the polishing efficiency of all the abrasives are improved by $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doping. The detailed analysis shows that the $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.92} \mathrm{Y}_{0.08} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives has the highest MRR in a series of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives, and its MRR increased by $56 \%$ compared with that of the pure. In addition, the CMP performance of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{La}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives were also tested synchronously. The trend of MRR of $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ doped and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ doped abrasives are improved with the amount of doping are increased, which is consistent with $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doped abrasives. For a certain doping amount, there is no significant difference in the morphology of all kinds of abrasives, and the enhancement of MRR is mainly attributed to the elevation of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration. At a low doping levels, even if the abrasive has a large particle size, it cannot achieve a high MRR due to its low chemical activity. That is, the chemical activity of the abrasive is the dominant factor affecting its MRR at low doping. Whereas, at high doping levels, the smaller particle size achieves a higher removal performance due to the higher chemical activity. For a certain doping type, the morphology of the abrasive changes from spherical to octahedral, the particle size gradually decreases, and the concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ on the abrasive surface increases with the doping amount increases. A number of factors combine to cause changes in the MRR of abrasives. The continuous reduction of particle size is not conducive to the improvement of MRR. Therefore, the morphological transition and the improvement of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration caused by the

Fig. 7. Material removal rates of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{La}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives $(x=0.00,0.02,0.04,0.06,0.08,0.10)$ on quartz glass substrates.
continuous increase of doping amount are the key to promote MRR. However, the morphology of the abrasive tends to stabilize after $\times=$ 0.04 , and its enhancement of the MRR is not significant at higher doping levels. The comprehensive analysis of the above results shows that the polishing efficiency of abrasives is improved by $\mathrm{M}^{3+}$ doping, which is obviously attributed to the increase of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration. It is worth noting that the $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.92} \mathrm{Y}_{0.08} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives show an excellent removal performance, which is contributed to the synergistic effect of the chemical and mechanical of the abrasives on the substrate is relatively optimal when the doping amount ( $x$ ) is 0.08 . Similarly, $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.92} \mathrm{La}_{0.08} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.92} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.08} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives obtain MRRs of 562.66 and $578.74 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$, respectively, which corresponds to the best performance in their groups. However, the mechanical action of the abrasives is significantly reduced due to the small particle size when the doping amount continues to increase, and the imbalance of the synergy leads to the decrease of its MRR. In addition, the relatively small abrasives is more likely to be embedded in the polishing pad with a groove structure, which makes them to be invalid in polishing. This result also reflects the fact that a certain particle size is necessary for the abrasives.

### 3.7. Surface quality

The high precision and low damage to the polished surface are the advantages of CMP over other flattening techniques [27]. Therefore, the surface quality of the polished surface of the substrates were characterized by AFM. The 2-dimensional (2D) height images and the corresponding line roughness curves of the quartz glass surface before and after polishing were obtained. In the 2D-AFM images, the dark and light areas present valley and crest of the surface, respectively, which means that the lower the contrast ratio of the color, the better the surface quality of the material. Meanwhile, the low peak-to-peak (pk-pk) also reflects the excellent surface smoothness from the line profile curves. Fig. 8(a)-(c) are the evaluated surface quality of the initial quartz glass. Many pits and scratches were observed on the surface, which indicates its poor condition. The line profile with a pk-pk value of 6.08 nm and the uneven 3D surface also indicate bad conditions. As shown in Fig. 8(d)-(f), a significantly improved surface (the surface is nearly smooth, and the pk-pk value of the line profile is only 1.37 nm ) was observed after polishing with the pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives, which reflects the key role of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives in CMP. Fig. 9 shows AFM images and corresponding line profile curves of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrates after CMP with $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives. The surface quality of the polished glass is significantly improved compared with the initial quartz glass, and the pk-pk of the line profile curves of all samples reach $\sim 1.00 \mathrm{~nm}$. The AFM evaluation after polishing using $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{La}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives are shown in Figs. S8 and S9, respectively, and they all show excellent results. Fig. 10 shows the average roughness ( $R$ a) of the surface of quartz glass. For all kinds of the abrasives, the surface roughness of the quartz glass was reduced from $\sim 2.3 \mathrm{~nm}$ to below 0.8 nm after polishing. Particularly, all kinds of doped abrasives show the best polishing quality for quartz glass when the doping amount is 0.04 , which may be due to the relative balance of the action between the chemical and mechanical of the abrasives in the CMP. Furthermore, the performance of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives is better than that of $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ doped and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ doped abrasives at the same doping amount.

### 3.8. CMP mechanism

Fig. 11 presents the schematic diagram of CMP mechanism for $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives to $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate. In the CMP system, the polishing pad and slurry are in direct contact with the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate [38]. The dispersed abrasives act as the carrier for the synergy of chemical and mechanical in CMP, and the study of its removal mechanism is worth thinking about. Therefore, based on the intuitive experimental data in this work, the role of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives in direct contact with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate was mainly analyzed. The doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives shows a continuous reduction in

size, which affects the CMP performance to a certain extent. As shown in Fig. 11(a), the small size abrasives exhibit a considerable amount compared to the large abrasives at the same solid content. However, some of the abrasives are stored in the grooves and become invalid particles because the pad usually has a special groove structure [39].

The proportion of valid abrasives in direct contact with the surface increases with the size, which means the improvement of MRR. In addition, the contact stress at the abrasives-substrate interface is shared by the large amount of abrasives, which makes the removal depth of the abrasives to the substrate shallower. In contrast, the large abrasives have

The results of evaluation for surface roughness of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrates after CMP using $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{La}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives ( $x=0.00,0.02$, $0.04,0.06,0.08,0.10$ ).
a strong local load on the substrate, which usually corresponds to a relatively low polishing quality [40]. Therefore, the medium sized abrasives that have a balance between polishing efficiency and quality is a good choice.

As far as the macroscopic changes of the abrasives is concerned, the doped abrasives also show a morphological transition from spherical to octahedral. As shown in Fig. 11(b), the octahedral abrasives has larger removal depth due to larger local force under the same load, which results in enhanced polishing efficiency [41]. In CMP, the motion modes of abrasives include sliding and rolling. The spherical abrasives are more likely to show rolling behavior, which also makes abrasives exhibit adhesive wear in the material removal. The study of Hoshino et al. [42] showed that the surface of the abrasives was attached with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ lumps after polishing, which confirmed this view. The octahedral particles with sharp edges show sliding friction, which significantly enhances MRR due to the groove wear. Furthermore, the local heat is generated due to continuous mutual friction at the interface, which makes the chemical reaction between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate more intense [43]. Similarly, the influence of the change of morphology on the polishing efficiency and quality is contradictory.

The advantage of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives over the others is its unique chemical activity, which makes it to achieve high removal efficiency at low solid content [20,38]. The perfect $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystals lacking $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ exhibit poor performance in a variety of applications including CMP [19,44,45].
![img-10.jpeg](images\img-10.jpeg)

Fig. 11. Schematic diagram of the CMP mechanism for $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives on $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate.

Fig. 11(c) shows the polishing behavior of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives. The polishing behavior of pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives follows the chemical tooth theory proposed by Cook [46]. In the slurry, the surface of the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate is hydrolyzed into hydrogen-terminated -Si-OH species ("soft layer"), and the chemical reaction between the abrasive and the layer forms a Ce-OSi bond. It is worth noting that the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}$ bond is a covalent bond with stronger polarity, while the Si-O bond has a lower bond strength due to the stronger bond length. This means that the Si-O bonds are more easily broken under the traction of mechanical force to achieve the removal. In recent years, the enhancement of CMP performance by $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration on $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive surface has attracted more and more attention. As discussed above, the $E_{\text {vac }}$ of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystal is significantly reduced after doping, and the free electrons trapped in the vacancy promote the transition of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}, \mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ as the active species promoted the removal, which was also confirmed by the CMP experiments. Seo et al. [47] showed that $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ has stronger adsorption behavior for silicate than $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ through theoretical calculation, which was also confirmed by experiments conducted by Myong et al. [48]. It can be seen that the increase of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration on the surface of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives greatly improves the contact probability between the abrasives and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate, which promotes the chemical bonding at the interface. Directly, the transition from $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ acts as a "reservoir" for electrons. After the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bond is formed, the stored electrons are transferred to the $\mathrm{Si}-$ O bond through the linked bond, which further weakens or breaks the SiO bond. The bond breaking caused by chemical action significantly improves the efficiency of the breaking only by mechanical action.

Furthermore, CMP is still a dynamic process that combines multiple physical scales. The final CMP performance is determined by the combination of multiple physical parameters. It is a proper research method to reveal the CMP mechanism by means of multi-physical field coupling technique and finite element analysis. That's what we're going to do next.

## 4. Conclusion

In this work, we prepared a series of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives with different types and amounts of doping by molten salt method for improving the CMP performance. SEM images show that all abrasives have uniform size and morphology. For all types of the doped abrasives, the morphology of abrasives changes from spherical to octahedral and the particle size also decreases with the doping increases. The larger the radius of the doped ions is, the more obvious the size change of the doped abrasives is. These visual changes in abrasives have significant influence on the CMP performance. The DOS and $E_{\text {vac }}$ of pure, $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doped, $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ doped, and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives were calculated using DFT. The $E_{\text {vac }}$ of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystal is significantly decreased by doping. In particular, $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ doped abrasives have the lowest $E_{\text {vac }}$ than $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ doping abrasives, which means that it is more favorable for the transition from $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. It was also confirmed by XPS that the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration on the doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive surface was significantly improved. CMP experiments show that the polishing efficiency of abrasives is enhanced by doping, but it does not improve linearly with the increase of doping. It is affected by the size, morphology and defects of the abrasives. The increased $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration and octahedral morphology of abrasives are responsible for the enhanced the polishing efficiency, which is regulated by doping. However, the size of the abrasives decreases with the doping continues to increase, which makes the MRR of the abrasives present a net decrease at larger doping levels. Therefore, the selection of appropriate type and amount of doping is the key point to improve the CMP performance. This study is expected to provide a scientific and reasonable method for the selection of the type and amount of doping for the preparation of doped abrasives. The molten salt method used is also a potential method for preparing $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles. In addition, the polishing mechanism of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives on $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate is explained from three perspectives, which will also inspire and promote the theoretical improvement and technological
innovation of CMP.
