#### Abstract

A successful chemical mechanical polishing or planarization (CMP) practice generally depends on the physicochemical properties of abrasive materials, including architecture, morphology, particle size and distribution, surface chemistry, etc. Defect chemistry engineering on $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based abrasives is fundamentally important to achieve high-performance CMP. Herein, neat and metal (Gd, Y, Zn) doped mesoporous ceria ( $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ ) particles were synthesized via a modified protective etching strategy. X-ray diffraction, scaning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption-desorption results confirmed the highly uniform particle size and spherical integrity as well as the porous nature of the products. Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy mapping investigations revealed that the introduction of metal dopants benefited the generation of more $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ sites and oxygen vacancy defects, thereby leading to the improved tribochemical and photocatalytic activities. Atomic force microscopy results of the polishing tests toward $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ films indicated that the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based abrasives offered highly planarized and scratch-free surfaces with angstrom level roughness, possibly due to their springlike structure and flexible abrasion effects. Especially in the developed $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-ultraviolet irradiation-potassium persulfate polishing system, the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based abrasives further presented a remarkable improvement in removal efficiency without any loss in surface quality. In this system, the doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ also served as efficient Fenton-like photocatalysts for activating persulfates, producing oxidative reactive $\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ and $\cdot \mathrm{OH}$ radicals and thus promoting the surface modification and material removal. This work provides a valuable reference for developing other functional and effective abrasive systems in reactive oxygen species-facilitated polishing.


## 1. Introduction

As one of the most significant rare earth oxides, cerium oxide $\left(\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\right)$ materials [1-5] with cubic fluorite-type crystallographic symmetry have received widespread interests due to their great potentials for usage in a variety of applications, such as three-way catalysts, photocatalysts, solid-state electrolytes, oxygen storage devices, ultraviolet (UV) blocking materials, polishing abrasives, etc. Chemical mechanical planarization/polishing (CMP) [6-9] appears to be one of most promising technology to remove materials at atomic scale and aims to achieve ultra-smooth and defect-free surfaces. $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based abrasives originally used for glasses polishing in optic devices for many decades are now applied in integrated circuits manufacture with high CMP performance
toward $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ dielectric films [10-12]. The morphological properties of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, such as the particle size and distribution, shape, crystallinity, exposed plane, and specific surface area, greatly affect the CMP quality. Various synthetic methods, including hydrothermal crystallization [13, 14], chemical precipitation [15,16], ionothermal synthesis [17], sol-gel method [18], solvothermal route [19], thermal decomposition [20], supercritical and subcritical dual-stage approach [21], etc., have been developed to prepare $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles with tunable dimension.

Many useful properties and applications of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based materials are intimately associated with the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+} / \mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ mixed valences and oxygen vacancy $\left(\mathrm{V}_{O}\right)$ defects, which can be nicely adjusted by doping with metallic dopants in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattices. In CMP applications, tailoring the surface chemistry of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives has emerged as another important

aspect as it may lead to further improvements of CMP properties. More and more in-depth studies [22,23] have revealed that the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ defects can serve as active sites involved in tribochemical reactions between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$, facilitating the formation and breakage of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds and thus accelerating the material removal of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ toward $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$. As a consequence, impurity doping in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives with selective elements is now emerging as an effective strategy for superior CMP activities. Up to now, more attempts have been paid to the optimization of the conventional CMP performance of the doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-involved abrasives [24-33] by incorporation of rare-earth or transition metals, which can availably control the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ concentrations. For further improvement in removal efficiency, doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive systems have been also introduced into photochemical (or
photocatalytic-assisted chemical) mechanical polishing [34-41] based on highly reactive oxygen species (ROS, typically hydroxy radicals $\cdot \mathrm{OH}$ ) by photocatalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports on the ROS-facilitated polishing based on potassium persulfate (KPS) activation using $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive systems. Compared with $\cdot \mathrm{OH}$ species, many advantages can be expected from the sulfate radicals $\left(\cdot \mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)$ produced through persulfate activation, such as longer survival lifetimes ( $30-40 \mu \mathrm{~s}$ ), higher oxidation potentials (2.5-3.1 V), wider working pH range (2.5-11), etc.

The synthesis and optimization of high-quality $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ porous abrasive particles still remain challenging. In this work, the parent and metal (Gd, $\mathrm{Y}, \mathrm{Zn}$ ) doped mesoporous $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}\right)$ particles with uniform sphericity and high monodispersity were prepared using a modified

protective etching approach [42]. For doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials, incorporating lanthanide and transition metal ions can be regarded as a feasible and effective strategy to create surface-defect structures (e.g., $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ ). With the metal doping into the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattices, more $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ were generated, which endowed the doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ with enhanced tribochemical and photocatalytic activities. In the as-developed $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ - UV-KPS polishing system (UV-CMP), the doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based abrasives also served as heterogeneous Fenton-like photocatalysts for KPS activation, and offered an evident improvement in the removal rate without any loss in surface quality. The main advantage of our bottom-up approach to particle synthesis is the predetermined control of the defect chemistry and structure engineering of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives.

## 2. Experimental section

### 2.1. Materials

Cerium nitrate hexahydrate $\left(\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$, gadolinium nitrate hexahydrate $\left(\mathrm{Gd}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$, yttrium nitrate hexahydrate (Y $\left.\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$, zinc acetate dihydrate $\left(\mathrm{Zn}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}\right)_{2} \cdot 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$, potassium persulfate $\left(\mathrm{K}_{2} \mathrm{~S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{6}\right.$, KPS), ethanol, acetone, sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K30) were all obtained from Sinopharm Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Ethylene glycol (EG) and hydrochloric acid ( $\mathrm{HCl}, 37 \%$ ) were obtained from Chinasun Specialty Products Co., Ltd. All chemicals are of analytical grade without further purification. Deionized (DI) water was used throughout the experiments.

### 2.2. Particle synthesis and characterization

Monodisperse spherical $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ particles were synthesized by protective etching of PVP-modified oxide precursors with a low amount of inorganic acid according to the previously reported method [42] with some modifications. In a typical procedure, PVP ( 3.5 g ), $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ $(2.2 \mathrm{~g})$, and EG $(20 \mathrm{~mL})$ were charged into a three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a thermometer, and a $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ inlet. The mixture was heated to $70^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in an oil bath under magnetic stirring, then heated at 155 ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 1 h under $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ protection. After cooling to $120^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 0.7 \mathrm{~mL}$ of 12 M

HCl was quickly injected into the yellowish slurry to initiate the etching. The process was performed at $120^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 1.5 h under $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ protection and then gradually cooled to room temperature. The resulting products were collected by centrifugation ( $10,000 \mathrm{rpm}$ ), washed with DI water and ethanol several times, and dried at $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The metal (M: Gd, Y, or Zn ) doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ were prepared via a similar procedure, expect that a certain amounts of $\mathrm{Gd}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \quad \mathrm{Y}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, or Zn $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}\right)_{2} \cdot 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ were also added into the initial reaction system, respectively. In this work, the $\mathrm{M} /(\mathrm{Ce}+\mathrm{M})$ (M: Gd, Y, or Zn ) molar percentage was set at $15 \%$. For brevity, the metal-doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ samples are denoted as $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Gd}, \mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Y}$, and $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}$, respectively.

The crystalline phases of the samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/Max 2500 PC diffractometer ( $\mathrm{Cu} \mathrm{K} \alpha$ radiation, $\lambda=1.5418 \AA, 2 \theta=10-80^{\circ}$ ). The particle morphology and microstructure were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, SUPRA 55, ZEISS). The particle size distribution was obtained using the open-source image processing program Nano Measurer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were recorded on a JEOL JEM-2100 electron microscope. High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) scanning transmission electron microscopy images combined with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX) maps were acquired using a FEI Talos 200 s electron microscope operated at 300 kV . The surface chemical composition of the prepared samples was examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a ULVAC- PHI-5000 spectrometer using Al K $\alpha$ radiation ( 1486.6 eV ). The binding energy of the C 1 s peak ( $\mathrm{BE}=284.8$ eV ) was used as the reference to calibrate the XPS data. $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ adsorptiondesorption experiments were performed on a Micromeritics TriStar 3020 analyzer at $-196{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to determine the specific surface areas, pore size, and volume of the prepared samples using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model, respectively. The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on an ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscope (UV-Vis DRS, UV3600, Shimadzu) in the wavelength range from 200 to 800 nm . A ThermoFisher DXR Raman spectroscope at an excitation wavelength of 532 nm was used to collect Raman spectra of the samples.

### 2.3. Polishing experiments with $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ abrasives

Silicon wafers with a 1200 nm thermally grown silicon oxide layer were used as the target materials to be polished and diced into $2.0 \mathrm{~cm} \times$ 2.0 cm square coupons. Polishing slurries were formulated with one of the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based abrasives at a solid content of $1.0 \mathrm{wt} \%$ in DI water. These slurries were then adjusted through pH regulation with 0.1 M NaOH (8.0) and the addition of KPS ( 5 mM ) and PVP surfactants ( 1.0 wt $\%$ ). All polishing experiments were carried out on a benchtop polisher (TegraForce-1 \& TrgraPol-15 with a porous polyurethane MD-Chem pad, Struers) for 2 min using a slurry supplying rate of $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ and platen/head speeds of $90 / 120 \mathrm{rpm}$ at a downforce of 3.0 psi. In UV
irradiation-assisted polishing (UV-CMP), a 250 W halogen lamp ( $\lambda=$ 365 nm ) was installed as a peripheral UV light source. A schematic of the polishing equipment is shown in Fig. 1. After the polishing procedure was over, water polishing was also employed for 30 s using the DI water jet in order to remove the residues from the polished surfaces.

The finished wafers were cleaned by sonication in acetone, rinsed in DI water, and dried in air. Morphology investigations were performed on a Nanoman VS atomic force microscope (AFM, Digital Instruments) \& a Dimention V controller with a scan area of $5.0 \times 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and a noncontact 3D optical profilometer (Contour GT, Bruker) with a scan range of $722.1 \times 962.8 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. AFM topography images and height distributions were recorded in Tapping Mode using Budget Sensors

The weight changes of the substrates before and after polishing were measured using a Mettler Toledo XS105 analytical balance (exact to 0.01 mg ). In this work, the material removal rate (MRR) was determined using a weightloss method [34,35]. All the MRR and roughness results are the average of three replicated experiments.

## 3. Results and discussion

### 3.1. Physical and textural properties of $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based samples

The wide-angle powder XRD patterns of the samples are demonstrated in Fig. 2a. The strong intense diffraction peaks for the pure and doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ materials correspond to JCPDS PDF Card No: 34-0394, and arise from the (111), (200), (220), (311), (400), and (331) crystal planes of the cubic fluorite structure of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. No additional diffraction peaks attributed to other metal oxide phases of $\mathrm{Gd}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}, \mathrm{Y}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$, or ZnO can be observed from the XRD patterns of the doped samples. Consequently,
the $\mathrm{Gd}, \mathrm{Y}$, or Zn species were successfully doped into $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattices, thus creating $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{M}-\mathrm{O}(\mathrm{M}: \mathrm{Gd}, \mathrm{Y}, \mathrm{Zn})$ solid solutions rather than metal oxides. As shown in Fig. 2b, the (111) XRD peaks of the doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ samples slightly shift toward a higher $2 \theta$ angle side compared to the undoped ones. It may be due to the partial substitution of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}(0.97 \AA$ of ionic radius [42]) sites in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattices by the smaller ionic radii of $\mathrm{Gd}^{3+}(0.94$ $\AA[43]), \mathrm{Y}^{3+}(0.90 \AA[44])$, or $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}(0.74 \AA[45])$, leading to the lattice contractions and the shift of XRD peaks toward a higher $2 \theta$ value. The partial substitution will result in the generation of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ defects [46,47], which is one of the important characteristics of doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials, due to the charge compensation and lattice distortion in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ structures. As expected, the calculated lattice parameter $(\alpha)$ also decreased from $0.5457 \mathrm{~nm}\left(\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}\right)$ to $0.5408\left(\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Gd}\right), 0.5390\left(\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Y}\right)$, and $0.5435 \mathrm{~nm}\left(\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}\right)$. In addition, there is an obvious broadening in the (111) diffraction peaks of the doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$, indicating a decreased grain size in the doped samples. As calculated from the XRD data of the (111) peaks by Scherrer equation, the average crystallite size (d) of $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Gd}, \mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Y}$, and $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}$ were determined to be

Raman spectroscopy is a highly sensitive and effective technique to probe the structure disorder and inherent point defects in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials. Generally, Raman analyzes the existence of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ defects qualitatively, while XPS prove $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ defects quantitatively [48]. In this work, Raman measurements were performed in order to track the change in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ defects of pure and $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ samples. As presented in Fig. 3, the strong Raman signal at $450-460 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ can be ascribed to the $F_{2 g}$ vibration mode of the fluorite structure, which is associated with the symmetric stretching mode of the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}_{g}$ vibration unit [49]. Furthermore, the $F_{2 g}$ peaks in the Raman spectra of the doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ were slightly blue-shifted by comparison with the pure $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$. It may be attributed to the changes in the bond length of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}$, resulted from the incorporation of Gd, Y, or Zn ions into $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ host lattices. Additionally, the much weaker bands located at ca. $600 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ can be assigned to the oxygen defect-induced (D, generally intrinsic $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ defects) mode of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ [50-52]. The relative intensity ratio of the defect band $\left(I_{\mathrm{D}}\right)$ and the $F_{2 g}$ band ( $I_{\mathrm{F} 2 \mathrm{~g}}$ ) of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ fluorite phase, i.e., $I_{\mathrm{D}} / I_{\mathrm{F} 2 \mathrm{~g}}$, can be considered as
a good descriptor of the oxygen defects density in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials [53, 54]. It is generally recognized that a higher $I_{\mathrm{D}} / I_{\mathrm{F} 2 \mathrm{~g}}$ ratio imply more $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ defects in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems [50-54]. Herein, the $I_{\mathrm{D}} / I_{\mathrm{F} 2 \mathrm{~g}}$ intensity ratio of $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Gd}, \mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Y}$, and $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}$ was found to be 0.1451 , $0.1568,0.1560$, and 0.1592 , respectively. As revealed by Raman studies, the introduction of $\mathrm{Gd}, \mathrm{Y}$, or Zn species into the host $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ induces an increase in the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ concentrations due to the redistribution of electrons or disorder of atomic-scale structures.

The morphology of the prepared products was examined by SEM observations. The large-area SEM images (Fig. 4a, c, e, g) of the pure and doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ materials indicate good monodispersity and well-defined sphere morphology. The uniformity and stability of abrasive particles are the key indicators for their CMP applications. To further determine the size distribution, the particle-size distribution histograms of four samples were determined by statistical counting 50 nanospheres in the corresponding SEM images, as shown in Figs. 4b, d, f, h. The average particle size and standard deviation of $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Gd}, \mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Y}$, $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}$ samples were calculated to be $79 \pm 8,78 \pm 16,77 \pm 13$, and $79 \pm 12 \mathrm{~nm}$, respectively. As verified by SEM, the as-prepared $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2^{-}}$ based samples exhibit a comparable particle size and distribution.

The large-area TEM image (Fig. 5a) also confirms the uniformly spherical and monodisperse $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ particles with diameters of 70-90 nm . The high-magnification TEM images (Figs. 5b-e) further reveal that the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based samples consist of irregular porous structures formed by the disordered stacking of small nanocrystalline domains. For the pure and doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$, the corresponding HRTEM images (inset) show the lattice fringes with interplanar distances of $0.32-0.34 \mathrm{~nm}$, corresponding to the (111) planes of cubic phase $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The slight reduction in lattice spacing can be ascribed to the lattice contraction caused by the partial substitution of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ions with smaller $\mathrm{Gd}^{3+}, \mathrm{Y}^{3+}$, or $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ ions.

STEM-EDX spectroscopy is a powerful tool to analyze the chemical composition and element distribution of the samples. Representative HAADF-STEM image and the corresponding STEM-EDX elemental maps of the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}$ are shown in Fig. 6, revealing the coexistence and uniform dispersion of $\mathrm{Ce}, \mathrm{O}$, and Zn throughout the individual particle.

Pore properties of the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based samples were characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption technique. Fig. 7 shows the adsorptiondesorption isotherms and pore-size distribution plots, and the detailed physical and textural parameters of the prepared samples are summarized in Table 1. The physisorption of the pure and doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ presents Type IV isotherms with Type H3 hysteresis loops located in the $P /$ $P_{0}=0.7-1.0$, inferring the existence of the mesoporous structures with

slit-like pores in frameworks [42]. The BET surface areas ( $\mathrm{SA}_{\mathrm{BET}}$ ) of the samples were determined to be $42.02,47.25,43.69$, and $50.25 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$, having corresponding BJH total pore volumes of $0.07,0.11,0.08,0.13$ $\mathrm{cm}^{3} / \mathrm{g}$ and average pore diameters ( $D_{\text {pore }}$ ) centered at $8.25,10.08,8.47$, 11.24 nm for $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Gd} \mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Y}$ and $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}$, respectively. UV-Vis diffuse absorbance spectra of the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based samples were collected to investigate their optical absorption properties. As shown in Fig. 8a, all of the samples exhibit the strong ultraviolet absorption in the range of $200-400 \mathrm{~nm}$ due to the charge-transfer transition between the O 2 p and Ce 4 f states in $\mathrm{O}^{2-}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, which is also the characteristic absorption of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials. By comparison with pure $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$, the metal doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ samples reveal a red shift with a respective relative increase in the absorption range in the visible-light region. It might be attributed to the transformation of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions and the vacancy faults. The associated optical band-gap energy $\left(E_{\mathrm{g}}\right)$ was evaluated based on the absorbance spectra of the samples using the Kubelka-Munk function [55], as shown in Fig. 8b. The optical band gap was determined by extrapolating the straight-line region in the plot of $\left(\alpha h c\right)^{2}$ versus photon energy. In this work, the $E_{\mathrm{g}}$ values of $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Gd}$, $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Y}$, and $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}$ were estimated to be $2.87,2.59,2.65,2.74$ and 2.79 eV , respectively. A reduction in the optical band gap can be found for the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based samples, as compared with bulk $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials (typically ca. 3.2 eV of $E_{\mathrm{g}}$ ). Furthermore, the metal doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ exhibit
an improved red shift in the band-gap energy compared with the pristine $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$. It can be attributed to the formation of localized band-gap states (or doping-related transition states) due to the presence of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ defects and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions in the doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ skeletons. The narrowed band gap and improved absorption efficiency imply that more photoinduced electron-hole pairs can be generated under light irradiation, which also contribute to an enhanced photocatalysis activity due to the efficiently separated charge carriers and recombination suppression. The band edge positions of the conduction band $\left(E_{\mathrm{CB}}\right)$ and valence band $\left(E_{\mathrm{VB}}\right)$ can be further calculated from the following equations [52].
$E_{\mathrm{VB}}=\chi-E_{\mathrm{v}}+0.5 E_{\mathrm{g}}$
$E_{\mathrm{CB}}=E_{\mathrm{VB}}-E_{\mathrm{g}}$
Herein, $\chi$ is the absolute electronegativity of the semiconductor (5.56 eV for $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ ), $E_{\mathrm{c}}$ is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (4.5 eV ), and $E_{\mathrm{g}}$ is the estimated optical band gap. For the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}, \mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-$ Gd, $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Y}$, and $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}$ samples, the $E_{\mathrm{CB}}$ edge potentials were found to be $-0.39,-0.32,-0.33$ and -0.30 eV , while the $E_{\mathrm{VB}}$ edge potentials were determined to be $2.51,2.44,2.45$, and 2.42 eV , respectively. These results clearly indicate that incorporating $\mathrm{Gd}, \mathrm{Y}$, or Zn dopants into the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattices alterate the electronic strctures of the metal doping products.

XPS technique was used to illustrate the information of the oxidation state of the elements and surface composition in the prepared samples. For the pure and doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$, the existence of $\mathrm{Ce}, \mathrm{O}$, or $\mathrm{Gd}, \mathrm{Y}$, and Zn elements was identified by the wide-range survey XPS spectra (Fig. 9). Fig. 10 shows the high-resolution Ce 3d core level XPS spectra in the energy range of $875-925 \mathrm{eV}$ and the corresponding Gaussian peakfitting results of the pure and doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ samples. On account of spin-orbit coupling, the deconvoluted Ce 3d spectra can be resolved into ten binding energy peaks with five pairs of spin-orbit doublets [56]. The peaks denoted as $u$ and $v$ were attributed to $\mathrm{Ce} 3 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce} 3 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}$ spin-orbit states, respectively. The labels of $(u, v),\left(u^{\prime \prime}, v^{\prime \prime}\right)$, and $\left(u^{\prime \prime \prime}\right.$, $\left.v^{\prime \prime \prime}\right)$ can be ascribed to $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ species, associating with the final states of $\mathrm{Ce}\left(3 \mathrm{~d}^{9} 4 \mathrm{f}^{5}\right) \mathrm{O}\left(2 \mathrm{p}^{5}\right), \mathrm{Ce}\left(3 \mathrm{~d}^{9} 4 \mathrm{f}^{1}\right) \mathrm{O}\left(2 \mathrm{p}^{5}\right)$ and $\mathrm{Ce}\left(3 \mathrm{~d}^{9} 4 \mathrm{f}^{2}\right) \mathrm{O}\left(2 \mathrm{p}^{4}\right)$, respectively. The peaks labeled with $\left(u_{0}, v_{0}\right)$ and $\left(u^{\prime}, v^{\prime}\right)$ can be assigned to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ species, corresponding to the $\mathrm{Ce}\left(3 \mathrm{~d}^{9} 4 \mathrm{f}^{1}\right) \mathrm{O}\left(2 \mathrm{p}^{6}\right)$ and Ce $\left(3 \mathrm{~d}^{9} 4 \mathrm{f}^{1}\right) \mathrm{O}\left(2 \mathrm{p}^{5}\right)$, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10, the yellow green peaks are attributed to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, while the purple peaks are assigned to $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$. In addition, the pure and doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ samples have similar binding energy peaks associated with the coexistence of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ species. According to the peak areas $(A)$, the content of surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions can be calculated using the following Eq. (3). Herein, the order of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content is as follows: $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Gd}(48.95 \%)>\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Y}\left(45.59 \%\right)>$ $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}(45.32 \%)>\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}(42.98 \%)$, confirming that metal doping
contribute to the enriched $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ sites in $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ materials.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Ce}^{3+} \% & =\frac{\mathrm{A}\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right)}{\mathrm{A}\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right)+\mathrm{A}\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}\right)} \\
& =\frac{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{He}}+\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{sc}}+\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{Fe}}+\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{v}}}{\left(\mathrm{~A}_{\mathrm{He}}+\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{sc}}+\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{Fe}}+\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{v}}\right)+\left(\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{sc}}+\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{sc}}+\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{v}}\right. \\

\end{aligned}
$$

The $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration can also be correlated to the amount of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ defects. More $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ commonly exist in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems with higher $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentrations. Hence, the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ content of the samples were further estimated by the Eq. (4) [57]. The $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ concentrations were determined to be $10.74 \%, 12.23 \%, 11.39 \%$, and $11.33 \%$, for the neat $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$, $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Gd}, \mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Y}$, and $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}$ samples, respectively.
$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}=1-\left(3 \times \mathrm{Ce}^{3+}+4 \times \mathrm{Ce}^{4+}\right) / 4$
The surface oxygen species of the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based samples were investigated by the high-resolution O 1 s core level XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 11, the binding energy peaks at ca. 530.5 and 528.9 eV can be attributed to chemisorbed oxygen species or surface $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$groups $\left(\mathrm{O}_{\text {ads }}\right)$ and lattice oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{\text {lat }}\right)$, respectively. The $\mathrm{O}_{\text {ads }}$ might be transformed from the active oxygen species adsorbed on $\mathrm{O}_{\text {lat }}$ through $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ defects [52,58]. According to the integral peak areas, the ratio of the

$\mathrm{O}_{\text {ads }}$ amount relative to the total oxygen species $\left(\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{ads}} /\left(\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{ads}}+\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{las}}\right)\right)$ increased in the order of $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}(76.67 \%)<\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Y}(83.02 \%)<$ $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}(88.99 \%)<\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Gd}(89.32 \%)$, indicating that the introduction of the various metals into $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ endowed the enriched $\mathrm{O}_{\text {ads }}$ and surface $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$groups in $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based materials.

For $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Gd}$ samples, the high-resolution Gd 4 d spectra (Fig. 12a) revealed the peaks at ca. $141.9 \mathrm{eV}\left(\mathrm{Gd} 4 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}\right)$ and $147.1 \mathrm{eV}\left(\mathrm{Gd} 4 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}\right)$ assigned to the spin-orbit doublets [59]. As shown in Fig. 12b, the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Y}$ products presented the peaks at $157.3 \mathrm{eV}\left(\mathrm{Y} 3 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}\right)$ and 159.5 $\mathrm{eV}\left(\mathrm{Y} 3 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}\right)$ [60]. In addition, the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}$ samples (Fig. 12c)

exhibited the peaks at $1022.7 \mathrm{eV}\left(\mathrm{Zn} 2 \mathrm{p}_{3 / 2}\right)$ and $1044.8 \mathrm{eV}\left(\mathrm{Zn} 2 \mathrm{p}_{1 / 2}\right)$ [61].

### 3.2. Polishing performance evaluations

Surface quality and removal efficiency are the crucial benchmarks for evaluating the polishing properties of abrasive particles. In this work, the morphology, roughness, and defect of the surfaces before and after polishing were characterized using high-resolution AFM in a scanning range of $5.0 \times 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. In a two-dimensional (2D) AFM height image, the bright areas indicate the relatively high positions (e.g., peaks), while the dark domains represent the relatively low regions (e.g., valleys). Consequently, more difference in color distribution generally implies a rougher appearance. The typical AFM height image of the as-received wafer clearly confirm this non-uniformity throughout the surface, as shown in Fig. 13a ( 5.0 nm in $Z$ scale). The arithmetic average roughness (Ra) and root-mean-square roughness ( $R q$ ) were measured to be 7.84 and $9.18 \AA$, respectively. The line-trace along the white dashed line (Fig. 13b, Line 0) further reveals the topographic variation ranged from +2.21 nm to -1.59 nm , thus determining a peak-to-valley (PV) value of 3.80 nm .

Fig. 14 shows the representative AFM height images ( 2.0 nm in $Z$ scale) of the substrates after CMP with $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}$ abrasives, demonstrating the ultra-smooth and scratch-free surfaces. The mean $R a$ and $R q$ roughness of the polished surfaces reduced to 1.25 and $1.59 \AA \mathrm{~nm}$ $\left(\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}\right)$ as well as 1.18 and $1.81 \AA\left(\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}\right)$, respectively. The topographic variations also decreased to $+0.36 \sim-0.33 \mathrm{~nm}\left(\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}\right.$, PV: 0.69 nm , Line 1) and $+0.36 \sim-0.26 \mathrm{~nm}\left(\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}\right.$, PV: 0.62 nm , Line 2), respectively. The change in surface topography was also tracked in terms of the corresponding AFM oblique images and lateral views. As shown in Fig. 15, the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based abrasives validly removed the nanoscale asperities from the original wafer, thus creating high-quality surfaces without leaving mechanical scratches or other defects.

The surface characteristics, including AFM height images, profile curvatures, the corresponding oblique images and lateral views (Figs. 16 and 17), also verify the formation of highly planarized wafters after UV-CMP with the neat and doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ abrasives. The topographic variations (Lines 3-6) and PV data were determined to be in the ranges of $\pm 0.4 \mathrm{~nm}$ and $0.54-0.70 \mathrm{~nm}$, respectively. To further verify the credibility of the results, the large-scale surface morphology of the wafer after UV-CMP with $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-Gd abrasives was measured using a 3D optical surface profiler in a scanning range of $722.1 \times 962.8 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. No

obvious surface defects such as mechanical scratches, chemical pits, and particle residues can be found from Fig. 18.

Table 2 summarizes the mean $R a$ and $R q$ data of the wafers after CMP and UV-CMP experiments. All the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based abrasives achieved the ultra-smooth surfaces with angstrom-level accuracy (typically $1-2 \AA$ of $R q$ ). The pure $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ abrasives offered a comparable roughness under both CMP ( $1.59 \pm 0.16 \AA$ of $R q$ ) and UV-CMP ( $1.57 \pm 0.12 \AA$ of $R q$ ) conditions. For the metal doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ systems, the surface quality achieved under UV-CMP (1.48-1.76 $\AA$ of $R q$ ) is better than those of CMP tests (1.81-2.28 $\AA$ of $R q$ ).

The surface quality of the finished wafer highly depends on the processing parameters, pad conditions, component and chemistry of the slurry, physicochemical properties of the abrasive particles, etc. Among these factors, tailoring the mechanical characteristics of abrasive particles is important for the optimization of abrasive-wafer contact behavior and the reduction or even elimination in scratch defects. Fig. 19 shows the schematic illustration of the proposed interface contact between the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ abrasives and the polished substrate. In this work, the results of physisorption and TEM clearly confirmed the porous nature of the prepared materials, which could be expected to reduce the overall modulus and hardness of $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based particles. The flexible or soft abrasives may elastically deform under an applied downforce,
which generally results in a low friction at the interface and helps to reduce surface damages [62-65]. Therefore, the eliminations in surface damages and scratches can be attributed to the reduced mechanical action during the soft abrasion or soft polishing effects. In addition, the uniform sphericity and high monodispersity of the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based abrasives are beneficial to the further improvement in surface quality [66].

Removal efficiency is another crucial metric for assessing the polishing properties of abrasive particles. In this work, the average MRR data of the pure and metal doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ abrasives are provided in Fig. 20. It can be clearly referred that: (1) MRRs can be effectively enhanced under UV-CMP conditions for all $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based abrasives, (2) metal doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ abrasives offer a higher MRR than those pure $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ in both CMP and UV-CMP experiments. The doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ abraives offered average MRRs of $105-117 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ (UV-CMP), revealing a $26-40 \%$ increment compared with pure ones.

In the case of silica polishing with $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives, the effective material removal can be well interpreted from the classical chemical-tooth mechanism, as proposed by Cook [67]. In this model, the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surface reacted with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules or $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$groups in slurries, thus generating a soften hydroxylated layer of $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$. Meanwhile, the surface of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ was also dissociated by $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to form $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{OH}$ bonds. The silicates could be adsorbed to $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces through the interaction with

Fig. 16. AFM height images and the line-scan profiles of the wafers after UV-CMP with (a, b) $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$, (c, d) $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Gd}$, (e, f) $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Y}$, (g, h) $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{Zn}$ abrasives.
-OH groups [68]. The $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{OH}$ structures would react with the hydroxylated layer to form $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Ce}$ bonds, which exhibited a higher bonding energy than $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds [69,70]. Moreover, the applied mechanical force might contribute to promoting the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ structures. With the assistance of shear force and relative sliding, the interfacial Si atoms could be efficiently removed from $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surfaces through the multiple dynamic formation and breakage of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds. These processes can be described in the following Eqs. (5)-(10).
$\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH}$
$\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}+H \longrightarrow \mathrm{OH} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}^{-}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$
$\mathrm{SiO}_{2}+2 \mathrm{OH}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{SiO}_{3}^{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
$\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Ce}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{OH}$
$\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}^{-}+\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{OH} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}$
$\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{HO}-\mathrm{Si} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
Surface chemistry of abrasive particles also plays a crucial role in CMP practices. In-depth studies clearly confirm that there is a reliable correlation between the material removal rates in oxide-CMP and
surface-defect structures of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives. In particular, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ defects can be regarded as the tribochemically active sites, prominently promoting the formation and breakage of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ interfaces [22,23] and thus facilitating the material removal of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ towards $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$. In this work, the results of XPS, Raman, and UV-Vis DRS confirmed that the metal (Gd, Y, or Zn ) doping contributed to creating more $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ sites and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ defects in $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ materials. Consequently, the doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ abrasives offered a greater tribochemical activity and higher oxide removal rate than that of the undoped ones.

In UV-CMP, a series of heterogeneous Fenton-like photocatalysis reactions may be involved in surface modification and material removal. A possible mechanism for the production of active species in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ UV-KPS polishing system is illustrated in Fig. 21. Under UV-light illumination, the photoinduced electrons ( $e^{-}$) in $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ were excited and immigrated from the VB to the CB , and holes ( $h^{+}$) were left in the VB, thus contributing to the separation of photogenerated $e^{-}-h^{+}$pairs [71, 72]. The $h^{+}$could react with water molecules or $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to produce $\cdot \mathrm{OH}$ radicals. A portion of photogenerated $e^{-}$could combine with the dissolved oxygen to form superoxide radicals $\left(\cdot \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}\right)$. Another portion of $e^{-}$ could react with $\mathrm{S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{8}^{2-}$ to generate $\cdot \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ radicals. The produced $\cdot \mathrm{SO}_{4}^{-}$ could also combine with water molecules or $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to form $\cdot \mathrm{OH}$. As

catalytic active sites, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ at $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ surfaces would donate electrons for KPS activation [73-75]. Therefore, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+} / \mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ couples involved in $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ could participate in the reduction of $\mathrm{S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{8}^{2-}$ to produce $\cdot \mathrm{SO}_{4}$. Meanwhile, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ species might capture photoinduced $\epsilon^{-}$and converted into $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, restricting the recombination of photo-generated charges and thus promoting the electron transfer between $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}[76]$. Consequently, the oxidative reactive species including $\cdot \mathrm{OH}$, $\cdot \mathrm{SO}_{4}$, and $\cdot \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$could coexist in the heterogeneous Fenton-like photocatalysis system. These processes can be briefly described by Eqs. (11)(18). In UV-CMP, the highly reactive species might directly react with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ [77-79], thus accelerating the generation of $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ products, as proposed in Eqs. (19) and (20). The separated $h^{+}$may also participate in the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surface modification.
$\mathrm{CeO}_{2}+h v \rightarrow \epsilon^{\cdot}+h^{+}$
$h^{+}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \cdot \mathrm{OH}+H^{+}$
$h^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} \rightarrow \cdot \mathrm{OH}$
$\mathrm{O}_{2}+\epsilon^{-} \rightarrow \cdot \mathrm{O}_{2}$
$\mathrm{S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{8}^{2-}+\epsilon^{-} \rightarrow \cdot \mathrm{SO}_{4}^{-}+\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{3-}$
$\cdot \mathrm{SO}_{4}^{-}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} \rightarrow \cdot \mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$
$\cdot \mathrm{SO}_{4}^{-}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \cdot \mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}+H^{+}$
$\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}+\mathrm{S}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{8}^{2-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ce}^{4+}+\cdot \mathrm{SO}_{4}^{-}+\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$
$\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}^{-}+3 \cdot \mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$
$\mathrm{SiO}_{2}+2 \cdot \mathrm{SO}_{4}^{-}+2 \cdot \mathrm{OH} \rightarrow \mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}+2 \mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$
In this study, the reactive species produced from the Fenton-like photocatalysis process can be expected to enhance the surface modification of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ materials, facilitating the production of chemically reacted products that can be tribochemically and mechanically removed by $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives. Therefore, the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based abrasives offered a remarkable improvement in the removal efficiency in UV-CMP experiments, as compared with the conventional CMP.

Surface defects of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based materials such as $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ generally reduce the band-gap energy and prevent the photo-induced holeelectron recombination [51,80,81]. Due to the presence of enriched $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ defects, the metal doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ materials had sufficient

surface-active sites and improved photocatalytic activity. In addition, the doped $\mathrm{Gd}, \mathrm{Y}$, or Zn ions may behavior as $\varepsilon^{-}$acceptors and/or $h^{+}$ donors, also promoting the transfer of $\varepsilon^{-}$and $h^{+}$. Therefore, the mobility and generation of photogenerated carriers can be promoted in the
defective metal-doping $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$, accelerating the separation of photo-induced $\varepsilon^{\prime}-h^{+}$pairs and thus contributing to the production of -OH and $\cdot \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ species. In this study, the doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ abrasives offered a higher removal rate than undoped ones under UV-CMP conditions,

possibly resulting from the improvements in both photocatalytic activity and tribochemical reactivity. Herein, we compare the as-prepared neat and doped $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ abrasives with the previously reported $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based
ones, and the polishing performances (typically surface roughness and removal rate) towards $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ films are summarized in Table 3. It is reasonable to believe that the appropriate particle size, good uniformity

in morphology and sphericity, porous structure, enhanced elastic response, defective surfaces, enriched $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ sites and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ defects, narrowed band gap are the essential factors to achieve the superior CMP
and UV-CMP performance of the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based abrasives.

## 4. Conclusions

In summary, the neat and metal ( $\mathrm{Gd}, \mathrm{Y}, \mathrm{Zn}$ ) doped mesoporous ceria $\left(\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}\right)$ nanospheres with uniformly distributed sizes were synthesized through a protective etching approach. As confirmed by XPS, Raman, and UV-vis DRS, incorporating metal ions in the $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ lattices led to the evolution of more $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ sites and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ defects, which contributed to the enhancement in photocatalytic and tribochemical activities. The proposed $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{UV}-\mathrm{KPS}$ polishing system based on heterogeneous Fenton-like photocatalysis reactions was proven to be effective in improving removal rate towards silica films without any loss in surface quality. Herein, the defective $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$ served as Fenton-like photocatalysts for KPS activation. Benefiting from the porous and flexible $\mathrm{mCeO}_{2}$-based abrasives, the elimination in surface scratches should be attributed to the reduced mechanical action or low friction at the abrasive-substrate interface. The enhanced removal efficiency might be assigned to the highly oxidative reactive species ( $\mathrm{SO}_{4},-\mathrm{OH}$, etc.) produced from the Fenton-like reaction and photocatalysis process occurred in the coupling system. The involved surface modification and Fentonlike photocatalysis synergy should be further investigated in terms of In-situ XPS, In-situ Raman, In-situ Fourier-transformed infrared
