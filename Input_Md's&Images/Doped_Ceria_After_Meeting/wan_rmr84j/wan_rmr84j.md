#### Abstract

Ceria $\left(\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\right)$ possesses tribochemical ability and photochemical oxidation activity simultaneously. Herein, novel carbon-coupled $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ heterostructures were developed as functional abrasives toward photochemical mechanical polishing (PCMP) system. Polydispersed carbon spheres (CS) were uniformly grafted with pure and Y-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanocrystals via an in-situ chemical precipitation approach. The resulting $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ core/ shell hybrids were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. As confirmed by atomic force microscope, the developed hybrid abrasives allowed the nearly non-damage surfaces with angstrom-level roughness ( $0.10-0.13 \mathrm{~nm} R a, 0.14-0.16 \mathrm{~nm} R M S$, within $5.0 \times 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ ) in both CMP and PCMP experiments over oxide films. As expected, introduction of ultraviolet radiation and/or Y-doping modification were effective in enhancing removal rates (RR). The $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ abrasives offered a ca. $196 \%$ increment of RR-PCMP compared to the RR-CMP of undoped ones ( $139 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ vs $47 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ). The improved PCMP performance might be attributed to the cooperative effects of the $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ heterostructures (overall modulus reduction, $\mathrm{CS}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ heterojunction construction, surface defect manipulation, etc.). The possible PCMP mechanism over $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ was also discussed on the basis of the interfacial contact, the photochemical modification, and the tribochemical removal.


## 1. Introduction

Chemical mechanical polishing (or planarization, CMP) [1-3] is a process that removes materials by the synergy of chemical and mechanical actions to achieve highly planarized surfaces with angstromlevel roughness. As one of important components in CMP systems, metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) such as silica $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\right)$, ceria $\left(\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\right)$, alumina $\left(\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$, etc. are the most popular inorganic abrasives in polishing slurries. Colloidal $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ slurry is commonly used for CMP process steps in integrated circuit manufacturing such as monocrystalline silicon, shallow trench isolation, tungsten, copper, copper barrier metal (e. g., $\mathrm{TaN} / \mathrm{Ta}$ ), etc. $\mathrm{SiO}_{2} \mathrm{NPs}$ are also widely applied to develop novel green CMP slurries toward sapphire, diamond, titanium, copper, nickel, etc. [1-6] for achieving high-quality surfaces in semiconductor, microelectronics, optoelectronics, and aerospace industries. In-depth investigations on macroscale friction and wear of particles are essential to
develop CMP slurries for next-generation devices including new materials and complex structures. As reported by Zhang and coworkers [7], macroscale superlubricity on macroscale surfaces was firstly realized under ambient conditions, which was performed on the graphene coated silica surfaces.
$\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ NPs have been extensively investigated in multiple applications due to their excellent physiochemical, photocatalytic, electrical, and mechanical characteristics, as well as unique valence transition properties [8-10]. As one of the most popular abrasives in CMP applications, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ NPs [11-16] and $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based composites [17-25] have been introduced into the ultra-precision manufacturing of integrated circuits (typically dielectric films), ceramics, optical systems, microelectromechanical systems, etc.

In $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattices, there are coexistence of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ oxidation states and presence of intrinsic oxygen vacancies (Vo). It has been proposed that $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions, instead of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ species at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive surfaces,

provide the assistance to the breaking up of $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}$ bond during dielectric CMP, thus allowing a high removal efficiency over silica materials. For example, Kim and coworkers [11] reported a facile strategy to synthesize $\mathrm{CeO}_{2} \mathrm{NPs}$ with tunable $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentrations. It was also verified that an increased $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content contributed to an enhanced chemisorption between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives and silicate anions during oxide-CMP, which might be responsible for the improved removal rate toward $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ films. Additionally, Cheng and coworkers [13] synthesized lanthanide metals ( $\mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Nd}$ and Yb ) doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ NPs through a modified incipient impregnation method for $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content enrichments. As revealed by XPS experiments and density function theory calculation, the introduction of trivalent lanthanide species contributed to the Vo formation energy reductions, thus facilitating the formation of Vo and transition from $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. CMP experiments showed that both polishing rate and surface quality of silica wafer were obviously improved using the doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ NPs. Kelvin probe force microscopy investigations [16] further revealed that the formation of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ and the reduction of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ contributed to increasing the electron density and Fermi level of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ NPs after doping with trivalent lanthanides.

As one of typical N-type semiconductors, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2} \mathrm{NPs}$ have been widely applied in photocatalytic/photochemical oxidation processes due to their abundant surface defects (typically Vo and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ), admirable redox ability, and low-cost effectiveness [26], [27]. Nevertheless, wide bandgap (typically $2.8-3.2 \mathrm{eV}$ ), unsatisfactory light absorption, easy recombination of photoexcited charges highly restrict the practical applications and photooxidation activity improvements of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems. Coupling with other materials and/or introduction of dopants [28], [29], [30], [31], [32] are the effective approaches to overcome the disadvantages. For example, combination of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ NPs and carbon materials (typically graphene, nanotubes, fullerenes, carbon quantum dots, etc.) [30], [31], [32] is gaining great attention nowadays for improved photochemical/photocatalytic oxidation activities. For carbon-coupled $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems, the carbon skeleton can provide additional charge transfer pathways. Consequently, the heterogeneous structures can effectively prolong the lifetime of photon-generated charges, which contributes to the enhancement of photooxidation activities.

A typical CMP process commonly involves the dynamic synergy of chemical surface modification and mechanical (or tribochemical) material removal. Up to now, a series of surface treatment techniques such as photochemical/photocatalytic oxidation [33], [34], [35], electrical oxidation [36], [37], Fenton oxidation [34], [38], ozone oxidation [39], laser oxidation [40], etc. have been introduced into conventional CMP for enhancing chemically reacted activity and thus improving material removal efficiency. Among these methods, photooxidation technique offers several advantages, such as easy operation, high efficiency, less energy consumption, minimal secondary pollution, etc. Up to now, the mixed NPs (typically involved $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ ) [33], [34], [35] are the most commonly used abrasive systems in photochemical/photocatalytic oxidation-assisted mechanical polishing (PCMP) applications. These are few reports focused on the design and usage of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based composites as functional abrasives in PCMP systems, excepting polystyrene/ceriatitania [41], polystyrene/ceria [42], meso-silica/Er-doped ceria [43], and polystyrene/polyaniline/ceria [44]. Nevertheless, these composites as novel abrasives have some drawbacks such as high cost and complicated synthesis, which highly restrict their practical and commercial applications. There has grown up an urgent need for the simple and effective fabrications of high-performance abrasives over PCMP systems.

In order to resolve these bottleneck problems, it is highly essential to develop the functional abrasives featuring both high photochemical/photocatalytic and mechanical/tribochemical activities toward improved PCMP performances. Significantly, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials possess photooxidation modification activity and tribochemical removal ability simultaneously, which may be ideal for the development of the functional abrasive systems toward PCMP.

Inspired by the previous works, herein we report some of our recent
research activities in novel functional hybrid abrasives. In this work, pure and Y-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanocrystals were uniformly grafted on the surfaces of carbon spheres (CS) synthesized via a simple and facile glucose hydrothermal approach. The physicochemical properties of the resulting $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids were systematically examined via powder X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy techniques. The aim of Y-doping in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is to generate more surface defects (typically Vo and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ), thus allowing tribochemical and photochemical activity improvements for enhanced removal efficiency. The purpose of CS is to form a heterojunction with $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ for synergistically inhibited recombination of photoinduced pairs, thereby leading to the further enhancement of photooxidation activity. Herein, the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ shells and the CS cores can severe as an electron donor and an electron acceptor, respectively. Meanwhile, the low-modulus CS is also expected to reduce the overall modulus of the proposed hybrids for improved surface quality. The CMP and PCMP performances of the heterostructured abrasives were evaluated in terms of surface morphology and roughness, topographical variation, as well as removal efficiency. It was confirmed that the asproposed functional $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives allowed the formations of ultra-precise and nearly non-damage surfaces with angstrom-level roughness under both CMP and PCMP conditions. As expected, introduction of ultraviolet radiation and/or Y-doping modification were effective in enhancing material removal efficiency of $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives. The improved polishing performances might be attributed to the physicochemical characteristics of the $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ heterostructures, such as overall modulus reduction, $\mathrm{CS}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ heterojunction construction, surface defect (Vo and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ) manipulation, etc. This work aims to provide a novel approach to developing functional abrasive systems that can improve both surface quality and removal rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about the Cs-coupled $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ heterostructures as novel functional abrasives for improved PCMP performance.

## 2. Experimental section

### 2.1. Materials

D(+)-Glucose monohydrate $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_{6} \cdot \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$, hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), sodium hydroxide ( NaOH ), ethanol absolute, acetone, cerium nitrate hexahydrate $\left(\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$, yttrium nitrate hexahydrate $\left(\mathrm{Y}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$, and hydrogen peroxide (supplied as $30 \%$ aqueous solution) were obtained from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). Deionized (DI) water was used throughout the experiments. All chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification.

### 2.2. Synthesis of heterostructured particles

Polydispersed CS with multiple particle sizes were fabricated via a one-pot hydrothermal approach [45] in the presence of Glucose as a carbon source. In a typical synthesis, glucose ( 10 g ) was charged into 50 g of DI water in a Teflon-lined autoclave ( 100 mL ). After complete dissolution of glucose, the autoclave was placed into a pre-heated oven and maintained at temperatures of $180^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for time up to 4 h , and then cooled to room temperature. To ensure the carbonization of glucose and the formation of amorphous carbon, the proposed hydrothermal temperature is slightly higher than that of the normal glycosidation temperature of glucose. In this work, the resulting black or dark grey suspensions containing CS particles were directly utilized in subsequent preparations of pure and Y-doped $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids.

In the fabrication of $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CoYO}_{2}$ hybrids, the as-prepared CS suspension ( 40 g ) were dispersed in DI water ( 80 g ) with ultrasonic vibration for 10 min , followed by the addition of 0.72 g of $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, 0.07 \mathrm{~g}$

of $\mathrm{Y}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, and 1.28 g of HMT (dissolved in 40 g of DI water). Herein, the molar ratio of $\mathrm{Y} /(\mathrm{Ce}+\mathrm{Y})$ in the Y -doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ solid solution was set to 0.1 . Subsequently, the above mixture was slowly heated to 75 ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in a water bath, and the reaction was performed under magnetic stirring ( 300 rpm ) for 2 h at $75^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The resulting products were purified by repeated centrifugation and washed with DI water and ethanol several times, followed by drying at $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and calcined at $550^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in a nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h .

For comparison, the undoped $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ composites were also prepared using a similar procedure descried above with little modifications. Identical conditions as the previous syntheses were used, except that Ce $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(0.8 \mathrm{~g})$ were introduced into the $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ preparation.

### 2.3. Characterization and measurements

The phase structures of the products were analyzed using a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD, D/Max 2500 PC, Rigaku) with Cu-K $\alpha$ radiation ( $\lambda=1.4518 \AA$ ) over the $2 \theta$ ranging from $20^{\circ}$ to $80^{\circ}$. Compositional investigations were carried out with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, Avatar 370, Nicolet). Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) observations were performed on a SUPRA-55 microscope (ZEISS) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV . Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were obtained on an electron microscope (JEM-2100, JEOL) operating at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV . Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer LS45 fluorescence spectrometer (PL). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained using a UlvacPhi PHI-5000 VP III spectrometer with Al K $\alpha$ radiation ( $\mathrm{h} v=1486.6 \mathrm{eV}$ ). The particle-size distribution based on the dynamic light scattering (DLS) method was performed on a Zetasizer Nano ZS apparatus (Malvern Instruments, UK) using a He-Ne laser ( 633 nm ) with a scattering angle of $173^{\circ}$.

### 2.4. CMP and PCMP experiments

Fig. 1 presents the schematic view of the CMP/PCMP experimental set-up. In the CMP experiments, a rotary-type polishing machine (TegraForce-1/TrgraPol-15, Struers, Denmark) coupled with a porous polyurethane pad (MD-Chem, Struers) were utilized to finish the silicon oxide wafers (ca. 1200 nm in oxide layer thickness). In the case PCMP, a commercially available halogen lamp ( 250 W ) with a wavelength of 365 nm was used as an UV-light source. The photon energy of the UV-light should be higher than the band-gap energy of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ photocatalysts in order to ensure the excitation of photon-generated carriers at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces. In our experimental conditions, the applied UV-light source with 365 nm of wavelength can provide a photon energy of ca. 3.4 eV , which is higher than the energy gap of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (typically 3.0 eV ). Every polishing test was conducted at 3.6 psi down pressure for 2 min . The

rotation speeds of the head and platen were 120 and 90 rpm , respectively. And the flow rate of polishing slurry ( $1 \mathrm{wt} \%$ in solid content) was fixed at $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. For slurry preparations, the particle abrasives ( 1 g ) were dispersed in DI water ( 100 g ) under ultrasonic condition. And the pH values of the polishing slurries were adjusted to near 8.0 by 0.1 M NaOH solution. Prior to PCMP, the prepared slurries were irradiated by an UV lamp under ultrasonic treatment for 10 min . After CMP and PCMP experiments, the wafers were repeatedly cleaned by sonication in acetone and DI water, and dried by nitrogen flow before morphology investigations.

The high-resolution surface morphologies of the wafers before and after polishing were determined by an atomic force microscope (AFM, Nanoman VS, Bruker, equipped with a Dimension V controller) in tapping mode. Commercially available AFM probes (Tap300Al-G, BudgetSensors) with a tip radius of less than 10 nm were applied in all AFM measurements. The scanning rate and scanning scale were 1 Hz and 5.0 $\times 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ ( 256 pixels per line), respectively. The recorded original data were analyzed using the AFM system software (NanoScope Analysis, V 1.40) for the determinations of two-dimensional (2D) height image, three-dimensional (3D) oblique image, cross-sectional profile, as well as average roughness (Ra) and root-mean-square (RMS) roughness. In addition, the surface morphologies within $722.1 \times 962.8 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ were tracked using a 3D noncontact interferometric microscope (ContourGTK0, Bruker).

The mass difference of the wafers before and after polishing was determined by an analytical electron balance (XS105, Mettler Toledo, exact to 0.01 mg ). Polishing efficiency or material removal rate ( $R R$, $\mathrm{nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ) was defined as the thickness difference before and after polishing in unit time, and calculated as follows: $M R R=\Delta m / \rho t s$. Herein, $\Delta m$ is the mass discrepancy of the workpieces before and after finishing, $\rho$ is the density of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ layer $\left(2.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\right), s$ is the substrate area, $t$ is the polishing time. In this work, the presented roughness and $R R$ data were the average of three runs.

## 3. Results and discussion

### 3.1. Structural analyses of heterostructures

The crystal structure and phase purity of the pure and Y-doped CS/ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ were analyzed by XRD. The characteristic diffraction peaks (Fig. 2) of the samples locate at ca. $28.4^{\circ}, 47.5^{\circ}, 56.5^{\circ}, 69.2^{\circ}$, and $77.7^{\circ}$, corresponding to the lattice planes of (111), (220), (311), (400), and (331) of cubic fluorite-type $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (JCPDS No. 34-0394) (46). It indicates that the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is highly crystalline and also matches the results observed

by HRTEM. For the Y-doped products, the XRD peaks ascribed to yttrium oxides $\left(\mathrm{Y}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$ can hardly be detected, revealing that the dopant cations have been well inserted into the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ host lattices. In addition, the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ nanocrystal sizes calculated from the Scherrer formula ( $d=$ $K / \beta$ cos 0 ) are ca. 5.47 nm and 5.33 nm , respectively. The lattice parameters of the resulting hybrids were further determined from X-ray line broadening of the (111) diffractions using the Scherrer's equation. And the calculated data for the pure and Y -doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ are ca. $5.44 \AA$ and $5.41 \AA$, respectively. Ionic radius of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+} \quad(0.90 \AA$ [28]) is slightly smaller than that of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}(0.97 \AA$ [29]), hence a lattice contraction is expected due to the incorporation of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattices. Furthermore, the typical broad peak at ca. $2 \theta=22^{\circ}-23^{\circ}$ assigned to amorphous materials (JCPDS No. 29-0085) cannot be clearly found from the XRD patterns, implying the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanocrystals locate on CS surfaces and the well-defined core/shell structure formations.

FT-IR characterization over $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ was carried out to analyze the infrared absorption characteristics. As shown in Fig. 3, the peak at ca. $3435 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ can be attributed to the stretching vibration of $\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{H}$ (hydroxyl or carbonyl groups), and the peak at ca. $1620 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ corresponds to $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{C}$ stretching of the aromatic carboxylic moiety due to the aromatization of glucose during hydrothermal treatment [47]. The peak appearing at ca. $1384 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ may belong to the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{C}$ stretching vibration [48], implying the formation of the chemical bonds between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and Cs. In addition, the absorption peak at ca. $701 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ can be ascribed to the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Ce}$ vibration [49], and another week peak at ca. $486 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ can be assigned to the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}$ vibration [50]. These IR results are in accordance with the XRD analyses (Fig. 2).

The intuitive morphology and particle size of bare CS and hybrids were examined by SEM and TEM observations. As shown in Fig. 4a, SEM image clearly reveal that CS samples are spherical and polydispersed with mixed particle sizes. Typically, the CS products exhibit three kinds of particle diameters, namely, relatively small spheres ( $70-80 \mathrm{~nm}$ ), medium-sized spheres ( $140-150 \mathrm{~nm}$ ), and relatively large spheres (250-260 nm). The corresponding DLS result (Fig. 4b) further confirmed the relatively broad particle-size distribution ranged from 50 nm to 300 nm , which also accord with the SEM observations. As shown in Fig. 4c and e, the provided SEM images indicate that the resulting pure and Ydoped CS/ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids maintain good sphericity, and present relatively rough appearances compared to the bare CS. The microstructures, nanocrystalline properties, and direct evidences of the core/shell architectures were further confirmed from TEM observations over the pure and Y -doped CS/ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The TEM images of Fig. 4 d and f reveal a reduced electronic contrast around the Cs cores by comparison with the dense

shells (10-15 nm in thickness), which also proves the existence of the core/shell structures of the hybrids. It may be attributed to the weaker absorption of electron beams of amorphous CS materials than that of inorganic compounds. From the HRTEM images inset in Fig. 4d and f, the lattice spacings of pure and Y -doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ are ca. 0.33 nm and 0.31 nm respectively, which can correspond to the (111) planes of the cubic fluorite phase $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystals. Due to the smaller ionic radius of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ than that of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, the $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ ions may occupy the lattice sites of the $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ions and form Y -doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ nanocrystals. Consequently, the $\mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ nanocrystals exhibit a slightly reduced lattice spacing for the (111) planes compared to the pristine $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$.

In order to explore the charge separation and transfer properties, PL spectra of the commercial $\mathrm{CeO}_{2} \mathrm{NPs}, \mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ samples were recorded using a He-Ne laser source with excitation wavelength of 325 nm . A lower PL emission intensity commonly indicates a lower recombination rate or higher separation efficiency of photo-generated carriers. It is well known that high photochemical/photocatalytic oxidation activity can be attributed to the excellent separation efficiency of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. For $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials, the PL emission bands in a range of $400-500 \mathrm{~nm}$ are related to the different defect levels (Vo, dislocation, etc.) of the range from Ce 4 f to O 2 p band [51]. As shown in Fig. 5, the commercial $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ displays a strong PL emission peak at ca. 447 nm , indicating a high recombination rate of photoexcited pairs. Conversely, the excited pure and Y -doped $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids under the same conditions exhibit a significantly reduced intensity of the PL emission peaks, revealing that the photo-electrons generated by $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ can quickly migrate to CS materials. Furthermore, the $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ hybrids illustrate a lower room-temperature PL intensity compared to the undoped ones. It verifies that Y-doping treatment contributes to the charge separation and transfer enhancements, which may be responsible for the improved photooxidation activity of the functional $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ abrasives in PCMP.

The Raman spectra of pure and Y -doped $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids can be found in Fig. 6. The peaks at ca. $1350 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ may be attributed to the D band resulted from the sp3 hybridization of carbon materials [52,53]. The strong peaks at ca. $1590 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ can be ascribed to the G-band (graphitic layer) related to sp2 vibrations of carbon materials [52,53]. The presences of D and G bands further confirm the successful combination of CS with $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. In addition, the enlarged Raman spectra with a wavenumber range of $300-700 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ are also inserted in Fig. 6 a and b. The peaks at $455-459 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ correspond to the typical Raman vibration mode $\left(F_{2 g}\right)$ of the cubic fluorite-type $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials [54]. It is noteworthy that the peak of $F_{2 g}$ mode slightly shift to the low wavenumber after Y-doping, which may be attributed to be a consequence of the increase of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration [54,55]. The peaks at $576-587 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ can also be associated with structural defects of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials (typically Vo). Herein, the peak intensity of the band at $455-459 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ and $576-587 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ are denoted as $I_{1}$ and $I_{2}$, respectively. It is commonly recognized that the ratio of $I_{2} / I_{1}$ can reflect the concentration of Vo resulting from the presence of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems [54,55]. The calculated $I_{2} / I_{1}$ value for $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ (ca. 0.20 ) is obviously higher than that of $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (ca. 0.09 ), suggesting the Vo enrichment after Y-doping in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattices. In summary, the provided results clearly indicate that the $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ hybrids exhibit more surface defects ( $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and Vo) by comparison with the undoped ones, which are effective in both photochemical and tribochemical activity enhancements.

The surface chemical composition and valence states of $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ products were analyzed by XPS spectroscopy. The recorded XPS survey spectrum (Fig. 7a) confirms the presence of $\mathrm{Ce}, \mathrm{O}$, and C elements. The high-resolution Ce 3d core level spectrum further reveals the coexist of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ species at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces. Moreover, the peaks centered at ca. $900.5 \mathrm{eV}$ and $882.0 \mathrm{eV}$ can be attributed to the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ contributions, and the peaks at ca. $916.2 \mathrm{eV}$ and $898.0 \mathrm{eV}$ can be assigned to the $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ contributions. The Ce 3d electron core level and two group peaks (denoted as $v$ and $u$ ) obtained after deconvolution treatment are displayed in Fig. 7b. The labels of $\left(u_{0}, v\right),\left(u^{\prime \prime}, v^{\prime \prime}\right)$ and $\left(u^{\prime \prime \prime}, v^{\prime \prime \prime}\right)$ can be

classified as $\mathrm{Ce} 3 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}$ and $\mathrm{Ce} 3 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}$ related to $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, originating from the final states of $\mathrm{Ce}\left(3 \mathrm{~d}^{9} 4 \mathrm{f}^{0}\right) \mathrm{O}\left(2 \mathrm{p}^{6}\right), \mathrm{Ce}\left(3 \mathrm{~d}^{9} 4 \mathrm{f}^{1}\right) \mathrm{O}\left(2 \mathrm{p}^{5}\right)$ and $\mathrm{Ce}\left(3 \mathrm{~d}^{9} 4 \mathrm{f}^{2}\right) \mathrm{O}$ $\left(2 p^{4}\right)$, respectively. Two pairs of doublets, $\left(u, v_{0}\right)$ and $\left(u^{\prime}, v^{\prime}\right)$, for the Ce 3d bond energy peak can be ascribed to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, and the double lines correspond to $\mathrm{Ce}\left(3 \mathrm{~d}^{9} 4 \mathrm{f}^{1}\right) \mathrm{O}\left(2 \mathrm{p}^{6}\right)$ and $\mathrm{Ce}\left(3 \mathrm{~d}^{9} 4 \mathrm{f}^{1}\right) \mathrm{O}\left(2 \mathrm{p}^{5}\right)$, respectively, which are consistent with those reported previously [56,57]. The ratio of valence states of ceria can be semi quantitatively analyzed using the integrated peak areas of the respective valence states.

The data corresponding to the oxidation states, the binding energies, and the peak areas of Ce species are provided in Table 1. In this work, the as-prepared hybrids were annealed under non-oxidizing nitrogen atmosphere. The $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content is as high as ca. $42.6 \%$ for the $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids. In addition, the Vo at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces can be correlated the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials and created from the transformation of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. Consequently, the high $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content also imply the existence of abundant Vo at surfaces, thus leading to the improved photocatalytic and tribochemical properties.

The high-resolution C1s XPS spectrum (Fig. 7c) can be deconvoluted into five peaks centered at 283.8 eV, 284.4 eV, 284.9 eV, 286.0 eV, and 288.3 eV , respectively. It may be attributed to the graphitic carbon $(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{CHx}$ ), phenolic carbonyl groups $\left(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}-\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{O}\right)$, carbonyl and/or

ester groups ( $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{O},-\mathrm{COOR}$ ) of carbon materials [58]. These groups could be generated by a series of complicated reactions in Cs formations, including dehydration (e.g., aldol condensation, esterification), decarbonylation, aromatization, etc.

### 3.2. CMP and PCMP performances

### 3.2.1. Surface analysis and removal efficiency

High-resolution surface topography and roughness within $5 \times 5 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$, as well as the sectional line-scan profile of the wafers before and after polishing were investigated by AFM. For subsequent comparisons, the diagonals of 2D-AFM height images were selected for the profile measurements. In typical AFM-height images, the bright spots mean the relatively high regions, and the dark points correspond to the relatively low domains. Consequently, the improved color uniformity or reduced color aberration in height images imply the highly planarized surfaces. The representative 2D-AFM height image (Fig. 8a) indicates the rough appearance of the surface prior to finishing. And the average Ra and RMS roughness were determined to be 1.03 nm and 1.37 nm , respectively. The corresponding cross-sectional profile (Fig. 8b) along the dotted line reveals the maximum peak height (MPH) of 2.9 nm and the maximum valley depth (MVD) of -2.5 nm .

The Ra and RMS roughness data of three runs over the surfaces after polishing are listed in Table 2. In this work, the developed pure and Ydoped $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids as functional abrasives achieve ultra-smooth and high-flatness surfaces without distinct defects (scratches, pits,

residues, etc.) in both CMP and PCMP experiments. As shown in Figs. 9-11, the typical 2D-AFM height images of the finished surfaces demonstrate the excellent planeness, uniformity, and homogeneity compared to the original surface (Fig. 8a). For $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives, the Ra and RMS roughness obtained under CMP conditions are $0.11 \pm 0.01$ nm and $0.14 \pm 0.01 \mathrm{~nm}$, which are comparable to those achieved under PCMP conditions ( $0.13 \pm 0.02 \mathrm{~nm} R a, 0.16 \pm 0.02 \mathrm{~nm}$ RMS).

PCMP with $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ abrasives, the $R a$ and RMS roughness values decrease to $0.10 \pm 0.01 \mathrm{~nm}$ and $0.15 \pm 0.03 \mathrm{~nm}$, respectively. After conventional CMP, the line-scan profiles (Lines 1 and 2 in Fig. 9) present that the $\mathrm{Cs} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives enable the topographical variation reduction from -0.26 nm (MVD) to 0.27 nm (MPH). In the case of PCMP, the CS/ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids achieve the MVD of -0.26 nm and the MPH of 0.29 nm , as verified by the sectional analyses (Lines 3 and 4 in Fig. 10). After PCMP with $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ abrasives, the line traces (Lines 5 and 6 in Fig. 11) exhibit the topographical variation ranged from -0.29 nm (MVD) to 0.29 nm (MPH). An evidently reduced topographical variation also confirms a highly improved surface planarization degree.

As one of the most popular and powerful tools, AFM enables to provide high-resolution surface characteristics (morphology, defect, roughness, profile, etc.) with an angstrom-level accuracy. However, AFM can generally offer the high-resolution images within a relatively small region (typically $\sim 10 \times 10 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ ) due to the limited scanning rate. For tracking large-scale surface morphologies, the finished substrates were further examined using a 3D noncontact interferometric microscope within a scanning range of $722.1 \times 962.8 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. As shown in Fig. 12, the microscopic defects such as mechanical scratches, etching pits, residual particles, etc. can hardly be detected, also confirming the good surface quality after CMP and PCMP. These results clearly confirm that both $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ abrasives can reach surface roughness and topography variation within atom dimension, revealing the
application potentials in achievements of ultra-precise and damage-free polishing.

A comparison of 3D-AFM oblique images can provide direct evidences over the surface morphology changes produced by CMP and PCMP. As shown in Fig. 13a, numerous nano-sized asperity peaks can be clearly observed from the surface prior to finishing. After CMP or PCMP with hybrid abrasives (Fig. 13b-d), most nano-asperities were effectively removed, and the surfaces were highly planarized without introducing new mechanical and/or chemical defects, thus leaving high-quality ultra-smooth surfaces.

Polishing efficiency or removal rate $R R$ is another key evaluating indicator for a successful polishing. Fig. 14 shows the average $R R$ data achieved by pure and Y -doped $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives under CMP and PCMP conditions. In this work, the $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives offer an average $R R$ PCMP of $110 \pm 17 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ (with UV irradiation), leading to a ca. $134 \%$ increasement compared to $R R$-CMP ( $47 \pm 13 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$, without UV irradiation). In addition, the Y -doped $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives offer another ca. $26 \%$ enhancement of $R R$-PCMP ( $139 \pm 11 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ) with respect to the undoped ones. Introduction of UV irradiation and/or Y-doping contributes to the $R R$ enhancements for the developed $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ functional abrasives. Herein, we compare the as-proposed $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives to the previously reported ones over silica wafers under comparable polishing conditions. And the average $R R$ and surface roughness (within $5.0 \times 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ ) dada are summarized in Table 3. Among these porous and core/shell abrasives, the developed $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrid abrasives contribute to the further improvements of surface quality and/or removal efficiency, thus exhibiting superior polishing performance. It may be attributed to the enrichened $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $V_{\mathrm{O}}$ defects, the enhanced tribochemical and/or photochemical activities, as well as the enhanced structure stability.

In ultra-precise grinding and polishing, experimental and theoretical investigations clearly confirm that the physicochemical properties of abrasives highly affect the interfacial contact state, material removal behavior, surface quality, and polishing rate. Compared to conventional rigid inorganic abrasives, the flexible or non-rigid core/shell abrasives [17,19,21-24,36,41-44,59] and porous abrasives [60-65] with significantly reduced moduli contribute to the contact stress and indention depth reductions, as well as the contact area enlargement between particles and surfaces, thereby leading to the surface defect/damage elimination and surface quality improvement. The abundant internal pore structures can be responsible for the non-rigid mechanical characteristics of porous abrasives. For the core/shell composites with a thin shell [66-71], the elastic response and compressive modulus may be

mainly affected and determined by their involved cores. Ozden and coworkers [72] explored the stiffness and elastic modulus of B and N codoped carbon-based nanospheres (CNS, $50-250 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) produced using a chemical vapor deposition approach. Nanomechanical compressions on individual CNS spheres were conducted via a Hysitron in-situ SEM apparatus (PI 85 Picolndenter), and the elastic modulus of 33.3 GPa was calculated using unloading curves. For bulk $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials, the high elastic moduli of $249-264 \mathrm{GPa}[73,74]$ were determined through experimental measurement and theoretical calculation methods. As confirmed by TEM and SEM observations, the proposed $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids possess a thin $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ shell (ca. 10 nm in thickness), which is much smaller than the particle size of Cs cores (typically $80-260 \mathrm{~nm}$ ). On the basis of the discussion mentioned above, we can safely assume that the

Fig. 11. Typical 2D-AFM image within $5.0 \times 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and the corresponding line-scan profiles of the surface after PCMP with $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ abrasives.
$\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ composite particles exhibit a reduced overall modulus compared to rigid $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ ones, thereby revealing non-rigid mechanical properties.

As shown in Fig. 15a, the slightly elastic deformation of the non-grid $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids might occur under an applied down pressure during CMP and PCMP processes. It can be expected to achieve the larger contact area and the lower but more uniform stress distribution over the substrate surface. In addition, the spring-like $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ composites might easily adapt to the polishing pad asperities, hence contributing to the topography variation reduction and surface planarization improvement. Consequently, the nearly damage-free polishing can be achieved by CS/ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives, resulting from the uniform material removal and the

optimization of physical microcontact behavior [36,75-78].
In a typical oxide removal process, the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ films were firstly corroded and softened by the chemical components in slurries. Subsequently, the chemically reacted layers were removed through the mechanical (or tribochemical) actions of the particle abrasives in slurries. In weakly alkaline polishing conditions, the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ films reacted with $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ in aqueous solutions, thus leading to the formations of $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH}$ bonds and hydration layers. Consequently, the oxide $R R$ can be highly affected by the dynamic formation and removal of the softened corrosion products (typically hydrated layers) [78]. As shown in Fig. 15b, the grafted $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ NPs in the shells absorb the photon energy from UV irradiation during PCMP processes, and then can be excited and produce photogenerated electron-hole ( $\mathrm{e}^{-}-\mathrm{h}^{+}$) pairs. The photoinduced carriers can react with the surrounding environment to produce oxidation-active groups [30-32], such as $h^{+}$, hydroxyl radical $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{OH}\right)$, superoxide radical $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$, etc. These active species in polishing slurries are expected to provide extra and strong oxidizing activities, thus accelerating the formation of chemically reacted layers. It is commonly recognized that an improved oxidation

activity of polishing slurries contributes to the easily removed layer formation and thereby lead to an enhanced oxide $R R$. Consequently, the developed $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ functional abrasives achieve an obviously enhanced oxide-RR in PCMP conditions than that of CMP tests, possibly resulting from the enhanced oxidation and/or corrosion activities of polishing slurries. The photochemical oxidation mechanism of $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids will be discussed in detail subsequently.

For the oxide films polished with $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives, the material removal involves the multi-step process of the formation and breakage of $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds, which can be interpreted via the chemical tooth mechanism (solid-state tribochemical mechanism) proposed by Cook

[79] and Hoshino [80]. As shown in Fig. 15c, the water-associated tribochemical reaction might occur at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ interfaces [81], in which $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ could react with the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}^{-}$sites at the hydration layers of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surfaces to create temporary $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds. Recently, the adhesion energy between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ at different $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ contents was investigated by AFM force-curve technique [82]. It was confirmed that an increased $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ NPs surfaces led to the enhanced adhesion energy and interaction of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$. Subsequently, the relative-weak $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds could be ruptured through the relative motion and the mechanical action between particle abrasives and hydrated layers, thus leading to the effective material removal during CMP/PCMP.

Fig. 16a presents the schematic representation of the photooxidation mechanism toward $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids. Ina typical photochemical (or photocatalytic) system, the semiconductor materials are irradiated with UV light which causes excitation of an $e^{-}$from the valence band (VB) to the conduction band (CB). It can produce an oxidizing site $\left(h^{+}\right)$in the VB and a reducing site ( $\left.e^{-}\right)$in the CB. For the $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems, the

![img-14.jpeg](images\img-14.jpeg)

photogenerated $e^{-}$in the VB of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ will migrate to CB of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, and the photoinduced $h^{+}$can be generated in the VB and left on $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces. The produced $h^{+}$can further react with $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, thus generating strong oxidation ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{OH}$ radicals. In addition, the excited $e^{-}$can also react with oxygen and/or hydrogen peroxide, hence producing ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{OH}$ active species. It is commonly recognized that the effective separation of $e^{-} / h^{+}$pairs will play a key role in the enhancement of photochemical (or photocatalytic) oxidation activity. For the developed $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids, the recombination of $e^{-}$and $h^{+}$carriers can be effectively inhibited via additional charge transfer pathways [30-32]. The conductive CS skeletons will provide a flow channel for the photoexcited $e^{-}$from $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and prolong the lifetime of photoinduced charges.

For amorphous CS materials, it can be speculated that the electronic Fermi level is pinned between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) level and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) level [83]. The $e^{-}$in the CB of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ can be easily transferred to Cs surfaces due to the good conductivity and the presence of structure defects of Cs materials. And the $h^{+}$can also be migrated from the HOMO of CS to the VB of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, and can directly participate in the formation of ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{OH}$ radicals. Moreover, the charge transfer may not be prone to recombination because the LUMO level of CS may lie above the VB of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ [84]. The formed built-in electronic field contributes to the fast charge transfer and the photoinduced $e^{-} / h^{+}$separating efficiency. Moreover, the accumulated $e^{-}$at Cs can interact with dissolved oxygen to form ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$radicals, which may also readily react with water to produce $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$. In addition, the photooxidation and photoreduction of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ may occur at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces. Herein, the photooxidation of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ will create ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{OH}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$species, while the photoreduction of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ will produce ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{OH}$ and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$species. Such reactions will accelerate the effective separation of photoinduced $e^{-}-h^{+}$pairs. Consequently, the combination of CS and $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ contributes to the promotion of photogenerated $e^{-}$transportation, thus achieving the effectively suppressed recombination rates of photoexcited $e^{-} / h^{+}$carriers as verified by PL spectra (Fig. 5). The improved photooxidation activity can be responsible for the oxidation active species $\left(h^{+},{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{OH},{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right.$, etc.) enrichments in polishing slurries, thus promoting the formation of chemically reacted layer and then enhancing the material removal during PCMP.

In the Y-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ material systems [28,29], Y ions can create impurity level in the forbidden band of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. This strategy aims to create an acceptor level below the CB of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and facilitate the downhill flow of electron to the dopant level from the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2} \mathrm{CB}$, then suppress the photogenerated $e^{-} / h^{+}$recombination. After incorporation of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattices, the surface exposed cerium ions are partly substituted by $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ cations. The as-created Vo [27-29,52,85] can efficiently capture electrons in the CB and restrict the recombination rate of photogenerated chargers in the Y -doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. Consequently, the CS/ $\mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ hybrids present an improved photooxidation activity.

Fig. 16b shows the schematic diagram depicting the atomic structure of the Y -doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surface. Engineering surface defects (typically Vo and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ) is one of the most popular strategies for improving the physicochemical performance of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based materials with mixed valences of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. For doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ systems [52], the cationic variations in valence or radius commonly result in the enrichments of Vo and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, possibly resulting from the total positive charge and the Vo formation energy reductions over $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. It was further confirmed that the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ species existed at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces and formed a thin $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ layer with several nm in depth [86,87]. As shown in Fig. 16b, Y-doping modification can create more Vo and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ at the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces, which may also play a key role in oxide removal processes.

In-depth investigations [11-16,22,24,43,82,88-93] revealed that the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces might more easily adsorb and react with the hydrated layers of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ films compared to $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ species. Consequently, the involved $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces could be expected to be active sites and bind to the hydration layers. It was also proposed that the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}$ bonds might be weakened by the exposed $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces, thus facilitating the $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bond formations. It contributed to the improvement of the water-associated solid-state tribochemical reactivity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives, thereby achieving an enhanced material removal toward $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ films. In addition, the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ created at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces could react with water to form surface hydroxyl groups, which further reacted with the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}^{-}$sites at $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ films to form $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ structures. In summary, more $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and/or $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive surfaces contributed to promoting the tribochemical activity between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and then accelerating the $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bond formations, thereby leading to the enhancement of removal efficiency toward $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$

materials.
In this work, Raman spectra (Fig. 6) indicate that Y-doping in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattices creates more structure defects (typically $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ) at $\mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ surfaces. In photochemical (or photocatalytic) oxidation applications, an appropriate content of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ in photocatalysts can be expected to be trapping centers for the photoexcited $e^{-}$or $h^{+}$. It can effectively suppress the recombination and prolong the lifetime of photogenerated chargers, as confirmed by PL spectra (Fig. 5). For the developed $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials, the outstanding photooxidation activity may be attributed to the effective separation of photogenerated pairs, resulting from the created $\mathrm{CS}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ heterojunction and the enriched Vo. On the basis of these results, we can conclude that the $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ hybrids possess an improved photochemical oxidation activity by comparison with the undoped ones. As a result, the $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ functional abrasives can promote the formation of chemically reacted layer during PCMP, and finally contribute to the $R R$-PCMP improvement. Furthermore, the enriched $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ species at $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ surfaces can act as the active sites and then react with the hydrated layer, thus accelerating the formation and removal of $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III})-$ $\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonds between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ interfaces. The improved of both photochemical and tribochemical reactivities are responsible for the enhancements of formation and removal of chemically reacted layer.

Consequently, the $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeYO}_{2}$ abrasives allow the $R R$-PCMP enhancement by comparison with the undoped ones.

Although we have obtained relatively satisfactory consequences in this work, there are still a lot of worthy scientific issues. For example, more direct and solid evidence is needed to explore the intrinsic relationships among the structure feature, mechanical property, surface defect, tribochemistry, photochemistry, and polishing performance of the proposed functional abrasives. In addition, the fundamental understanding of the photooxidation mechanism of $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials and the synergistic effect between CS and $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ will be further explored in our group. In order to acquire more information, the relevant studies are under investigation in terms of AFM nano-indentation, in situ Raman, in situ FT-IR, in-situ SEM/TEM compression testing, etc. We believe these results will provide insights into the structure/component optimization, polishing performance improvement, and material removal mechanism of the developed $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ functional abrasives.

## 4. Conclusions

In summary, this work describes our recent efforts on the design and fabrication of $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ heterostructures as novel functional abrasives

for achieving low-damage and high-efficiency polishing/planarization. As revealed by FESEM and HRTEM, the polydispersed carbon spheres (CS) synthesized via a hydrothermal approach were uniformly coated with a thin pure or Y-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ layer, which was consisted of randomly orientated nanocrystals. The pure and Y-doped $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids exhibited the strawberry-like appearances with typical core/shell structures. Raman and XPS results showed that Y-doping modification contributed to the tervalent cerium $\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right)$ and oxygen vacancy (Vo) enrichments at $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces, allowing the tribochemical activity enhancement. PL spectra clearly confirmed that the created $\mathrm{CS}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ heterojunction was responsible for the efficient separation of photoinduced charges, indicating the photochemical (or photocatalytic) oxidation activity improvement. Under both CMP and PCMP conditions, the $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids achieved the nearly non-damage surfaces with angstrom-level roughness ( $0.10-0.13 \mathrm{~nm} R a, 0.14-0.16 \mathrm{~nm} R M S$ ). The involved low-modulus Cs cores might be responsible for the interfacial contact optimization and thus surface quality improvement. Compared to conventional CMP ( $47 \pm 13 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ), the $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ hybrids achieved an evidently enhanced $R R$-PCMP $(110 \pm 17 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min})$, which was further improved by Y-doping treatment ( $139 \pm 11 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ). It might be attributed to the acceleration of the dynamic formation and removal of chemically treated layers, resulting from the tribochemical and photochemical activity enhancements. The reduced overall modulus, constructed $\mathrm{CS}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ heterojunction, and manipulated surface defect might be responsible for the improved CMP and PCMP performances of the proposed $\mathrm{CS} / \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ functional abrasives. This work is expected to offer a promising abrasive system for achieving high-quality and highefficiency polishing. Moreover, the described strategy can be easily extended to the construction and fabrication of other CS-coupled functional abrasives toward advanced multi-fields assisted polishing (PCMP, ECMP, PECMP, etc.).
