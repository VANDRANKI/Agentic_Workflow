The synergistic effect of photochemical oxidation activity and tribochemical ability of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ material is a necessary prerequisite for the formation of photocatalytic assisted chemical-mechanical polishing (PCMP) abrasive system. However, it is precisely due to the large band gap ( $\sim 3.2 \mathrm{eV}$ ) of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and the high recombination rate of photogenerated carriers that the improvement of the photocatalytic oxidation activity of traditional $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ photocatalysts is greatly limited, thus preventing the further wide application of cerium-based abrasives in PCMP. Based on this, a series of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives were synthesized by molten salt method to improve the performance of cerium oxide based polishing paste with PCMP. The physicochemical properties of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples were analyzed by a series of characterization methods. The results show that $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive has a normal octahedral shape with a particle size of $190 \sim 260 \mathrm{~nm}$. With the increase of doping amount, the particle size of abrasive decreases gradually, but the photocatalytic activity increases. Compared with undoped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives, the removal rate ( $\mathrm{RR}=932.42 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ) of quartz glass by $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive was increased by about $87.10 \%$. At the same time, the surface quality has been

significantly improved. A smooth, flawless and low roughness surface was obtained. The improvement in surface quality can be demonstrated by reducing surface roughness (Ra). The Ra of quartz glass decreased to 0.36 nm after $\mathrm{Y}^{3+} / \mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ co-doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive by PCMP (the original Ra of glass was 1.08 nm ). It was considered that the size of the abrasive had a close relationship with the surface quality and the $R R$ of the polished glass. Meanwhile, characteristic co-doping strategy was conducive to increase the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and oxygen vacancy concentration of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles, which optimized the separation efficiency of the photogenic carrier of the photocatalyst. This further promoted the generation of oxidizing active substances in the polishing slurry, and therefore expediting the formation and removal of the chemical reaction soft layer. The removal mechanism of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-\mathrm{2 x}} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{Pr}_{y} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives in PCMP process was discussed.

## 1. Introduction

Chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP) technology is a kind of technology that realizes the global planarization of ultra-precision surface by the synergistic action of chemical reaction and mechanical wear [1]. It has a very wide application in the field of integrated circuit and optical device manufacturing. Traditional chemical-mechanical polishing processes usually involve the use of a large number of chemicals and high energy consumption equipment, resulting in environmental problems and energy waste [2]. To overcome these challenges, new green chemical-mechanical polishes have been developed for copper [1], sapphire [3], diamond [4], alloys [5], silicon [6] and molten silica [7]. Using the developed green CMP, the atomic surface implementation is used in the semiconductor, optoelectronics and aerospace industries [8]. These studies are a great contribution to traditional CMP and manufacturing [9]. Furthermore, in order to solve these problems, researchers began to look for more environmentally friendly and energy efficient surface treatment methods. In addition, with the development of technology and the expansion of market demand, the quality requirements for material surfaces are also getting higher and higher. In some applications, such as optoelectronic device manufacturing, small surface defects and contamination can cause device performance degradation, and it is necessary to find a way to remove surface defects and contamination more effectively. Therefore, some auxiliary chemical-mechanical polishing technology came into being, such as: photocatalytic assisted chemical-mechanical polishing (PCMP) [10], ultrasonic assisted chemical-mechanical polishing [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], electrocatalytic-assisted chemical-mechanical polishing [ECMP) [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], magnetorheological finishing (MRF) [22], [23], [24], plasma-assisted chemical-mechanical polishing [29], [30], [31] and so on.

Photocatalytic oxidation is an environmentally friendly and highefficiency technology, which has the advantages of less secondary pollution, low energy consumption, high efficiency and simple operation [32]. Photocatalytic assisted chemical-mechanical polishing uses photocatalytic reactions under light irradiation to enhance the effect of chemical-mechanical polishing, in order to achieve efficient, environmentally friendly and low-cost surface treatment. In the usual PCMP process, light irradiation of polishing slurry containing photocatalytic abrasives is crucial in workpiece surface removal [33], [34]. PCMP abrasive system has photocatalytic performance in addition to mechanical wear performance, compared with traditional CMP. Therefore, the choice of abrasive system is essential to the performance of PCMP.

Currently, the lanthanide sequences are being analyzed to evaluate their effectiveness as new elements for chemical-mechanical polishing. Among them, cerium $(\mathrm{Ce})$ is the most potential candidate because it has the environmentally friendly [35], [36], [37], [38]. Ceria $\left(\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\right)$ is considered to be one of the most efficient polishing abrades due to its uniform tribo-chemical activity and chemical tooth effect. Due to its volatile valence states $\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}\right.$ and $\left.\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right), \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is also considered to be a rare earth semiconductor photocatalyst [29]. Notably, it is the synergistic effect of the photochemical oxidation activity and tribo-chemical ability of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ material that is the necessary pre-condition for the formation of PCMP abrasive system. Nevertheless, it is precisely the large band gap ( $\sim 3.2$ eV ) of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and the high recombination rate of photogenerated carriers,
which greatly limits the improvement of the photocatalytic oxidation activity of traditional $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ photocatalysts [10]. Therefore, increasing the photocatalytic activity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ sample is of great significance for the successful application of ceria-based abrasive in PCMP. It is currently concluded that the photocatalytic property of photocatalyst can be efficaciously regulated with modulating the photoinduced electron-hole recombination rate. Although it is well known that excellent surface quality and material removal rates depend on the chemical reactivity between the abrasive and the substrate surface in addition to the mechanical wear capacity of the abrasive. However, the precise removal mechanism of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives when polishing $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrates is still controversial, which is an urgent problem to be solved in PCMP [39]. Hence, it is very important to research and regulate the intrinsic properties of abrasives to improve the performance of PCMP. Ma et al. [29] synthesized pure cubic $\mathrm{CeO}_{2-x}$ nanoparticles by pulsed plasma fluid phase method (PPL) in one step. Compared with commercial samples, the prepared samples have higher photocatalytic activity and better polishing properties for quartz glass, with the $R R$ of $520 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{h}$. This is attributed to high $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content and/or small particle size. Chen et al. [10] synthesized three-layer polystyrene/polyaniline/cerium dioxide (PS/PANI/ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ ) abrasives for PCMP. Compared with PS/ $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, the $R R$ of the synthesized abrasives is improved by about $69 \%$. This may be due to the optimized contact interface between the surface of the workpiece and the abrasive, in addition to the synergistic effect of the PANI- $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ heterojunction, which improves the photocatalytic activity and the $R R$. Chen et al. [40] prepared $\mathrm{mSiO}_{2} @ \mathrm{CeGdO}_{3}$ abrasives with strong light chemical and tribo-chemical activity and obtained excellent quartz surface quality $\left(R a=1.37 \pm 0.07 \AA\right)$ and $R R(145.6 \pm 20.2 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min})$ in PCMP tests compared to commercial $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. They believe that this is a combination of the increase of oxygen vacancy and ceria and the optimization of the interface contact state. These works lay the foundation for optimizing the functional abrasive system of PCMP by surface modification and structural adjustment of the abrasive.

Sabia and Stevens found that in addition to $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, there was a certain amount of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ on the surface of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ grinding particles during polishing. More studies have shown that the increase of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration on $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive surface significantly enhances its chemical action on $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate, thus enhancing its removal efficiency. The properties of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ materials can be easily manipulated by exogenous doping within the framework of their stable crystal structure to construct solid solutions [41]. Schmitt et al. [41] believed that cations with similar ionic radius but different valency to $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ were compensated by the generation of point defects, and doping trivalent cations was more conducive to the formation of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ structure. Because $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ have ionic radii similar to $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, it is easier to enter the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice. Inspired by previous work [29], [39], [40], [42], [43], this paper reports some of our efforts in the design and manufacture of Y and Pr co-doped cerium dioxide materials as streamlined functional abrasives for PCMP processing technology. It is an effective strategy to alter the microstructure of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based abrasives by co-doping and design different sizes of abrasives to improve the chemical reactivity, which is strongly connected with PCMP performance. Co-doping is used to prolong the recombination rate of photogenerated carriers and effectively enhance the charge carriers separation efficiency, consequently improving the

photocatalytic activity of the synthesized materials [46], [47], [48]. The purpose of this study is to heighten the performance of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based functional abrasives in PCMP through the co-doping strategy.

$\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives were synthesized by molten salt method. The synthesis steps are as follows: first, the weighed $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \bullet 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{Y}$ $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \bullet 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{Pr}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \bullet 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{KCl}$ and $\mathrm{KNO}_{3}$ were fully ground in an agate mortar, anhydrous ethanol was added, and then the raw materials were stirred for 30 min at a rotating speed of $400 \mathrm{r} / \mathrm{min}$ with magnetic force to fully mix. The raw material was placed in an alumina crucible and dried in remain unchanged temperature drying tunnel at $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to make all the anhydrous ethanol volatilize. Then, it was roasted in MF1100 C-S Muffle furnace (Anhui Beick Equipment Technology Co., LTD) at $850^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 4 h . The molten-salt $\left(\mathrm{KNO}_{3}-\mathrm{KCl}\right)$ in the hybrid was eliminated with deionized water for $4-5$ times to obtain $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 1.

### 2.3. Photocatalytic activity test

A 300 W xenon lamp (PLS-SXE300, Beijing Perfect Light) was used to study the photocatalytic performance of Tetracycline (TC). Before light irradiation, this was done by adding 25 mg of catalyst to TC solution ( $50 \mathrm{~mL}, 10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ ) and dark stirring for 60 min . The 3 mL suspension was drawn at a spacing interval and the supernatant was centrifugally derived in the course of the experiment. The concentration of TC in the supernatant was determined with UV-visible spectra photometer (P9, Shanghai Mapada Instrument). The characteristic absorption peak of TC is 357 nm .

### 2.4. Characterization

Quartz Technology Co., LTD., with a thickness of 2 mm and a diameter of 20 mm . The automatic pressure grinding and polishing model used in the CMP experiment is UNIPOL-1200S, which was purchased from China Shenyang Kejing Automobile Instrument Co., LTD. Synthetic leather polishing pad is purchased from Shenyang Kejing Automobile Instrument Co., LTD., China. The polishing parameters were set to: the rotational speed of the polishing head was $80 \mathrm{r} / \mathrm{min}$, the antistrophic speed of the polishing platform was $80 \mathrm{r} / \mathrm{min}$, the total time of each polishing was 180 s , the flow rate of the polishing slurry was constant $25 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, and the maximum loading force exerted by the polishing head was 3.5 kg .

The polished quartz glass was washed and dried repeatedly by washing combined with ultrasonic cleaning, and the properties of CMP were characterized. Seiko Instruments Inc. (AFM) was applied to survey the surface morphology of quartz glass and test its roughness at a scanning area of $5 \mu \mathrm{~m} \times 5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. The scanning mode was contact mode and the scanning rate was 1.0 Hz . The weight of the polished quartz glass was surveyed by using a precision electronic balance with an accuracy of 0.0001 g . The removal rate ( $R R, \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ) used to characterize the polishing efficiency was calculated by Eq. (1) below [49]:
$R R=\frac{m_{2}-m_{1}}{\rho \mathrm{At}}$
where $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$ are respectively the weight of the quartz glass after and before chemical mechanical polishing, $\rho$ is the density of the quartz glass used in this experiment $\left(2.2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\right)$, t is the polishing time ( 180 s ), and $A$ is the area of the polished surface of the quartz glass $\left(3.14 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\right)$. In this experiment, the final $R R$ is the average of the three repeated experiments.

## 3. Results and discussion

The XRD pattern of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Pr}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples is shown in Fig. 2. The diffraction peaks of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Pr}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples were well matched with $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ with cubic fluorite structure (JCPDS 34-0394). The peak positions are $28.5^{\circ}, 33.0^{\circ}, 47.4^{\circ}, 56.3^{\circ}, 59.0^{\circ}, 69.4^{\circ}, 76.7^{\circ}$ and $79.0^{\circ}$, corresponding to the characteristic peaks of the (111), (200), (220), (311), (222), (400), (331) and (420) planes of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystal, respectively [50,51]. And there were no other oxides $\left(\mathrm{Ce}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}, \mathrm{Y}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}, \mathrm{Pr}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right.$, etc.). It indicated that $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ are effectively doped in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice, which formed $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{Y}-\mathrm{Pr}-\mathrm{O}$ solid solution [40]. With the increase of doping amount, the diffraction peak of (111) crystal plane was shifted to high angle, which was related to lattice shrinkage. In addition, the half-peak width of the diffraction peak became wider after the introduction of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$, which indicated that the grain size of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystal decreases. This was consistent with the trend of size change shown in the following SEM images.

In ultra-precision polishing, the shape and size of the abrasive have a great influence on the basic friction behavior and mechanical performance [52]. Fig. 3 are SEM images and grain size profiles of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Pr}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples, respectively. The morphology of samples prepared by different co-doping concentrations showed no significant difference in octahedral shape. It can be seen that the particle size distribution of $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Y}_{0.02} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.02} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives were relatively more uniform from the particle size distribution diagrams. The average particle size of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Pr}_{4} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives was decreased from $\sim 260.36 \mathrm{~nm}$ to $\sim 197.65 \mathrm{~nm}$ with the increase of doping amount of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$. The reason for such changes may be due to the electrostatic repulsion between particles and lattice distortion caused by co-doping strategy, which can obstruct the crystal growth [53].

Fig. 4. Wide survey XPS spectrum of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Py}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples (b-f).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is a classically analytical method to identify the composition and chemical state on the materials' surface by measuring the excited photoelectron energy [54-59]. It is used to study the chemical state and element content of the sample. The samples' XPS spectrum are shown in Fig. 4. The spectrum show that only $\mathrm{Ce}, \mathrm{Y}, \mathrm{C}$ and O elements are identified in the samples, while $\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{Na}$ and Cl elements do not exist, which also manifested that $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Py}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ is monophasic synthesis. A large number of studies [54, 55, 58-60] have indicated that the cerium dioxide's chemical activity was bound up with $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration and oxygen vacancy concentration. Hence, the characteristic spectra of Ce 3d was analyzed in detail. Generally, the spin orbits $3 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}$ and $3 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}$ were signed with $v$ and $u$, respectively. The characteristic peaks of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ were the peaks of $v_{0}, v^{\prime}, u_{0}$ and $u^{\prime}$, and the peaks of $v, v^{\prime \prime}, v^{\prime \prime \prime}, u, u^{\prime \prime}$ and $u^{\prime \prime \prime}$ are assigned to $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$. Therefore, with the nonlinear peak fitting method, the peaks of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ were identified, as shown in Fig. 5(a)-(f).

Table 1 shows the peak area data and binding energy of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Py}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples in diverse valence states of cerium. The concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ can be calculated by Eq. (2), and the integrated peak

Fig. 6 shows the XPS spectrum of O 1 s , and they can be matched with three peaks [53,60,61]. The peaks of $\mathrm{O} 1, \mathrm{O} 2$ and O 3 were lattice oxygen, surface adsorbed oxygen and vacancy adsorbed oxygen respectively. The samples' oxygen vacancy (Vo) concentration can be obtained by calculating a ratio that is the ratio of the area of peak O 3 to the sum of the areas of all samples' peaks. Table 2 shows the peak area data and binding energy of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Pr}_{6} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples in diverse valence states of oxygen. The oxygen vacancy concentration of all samples synthesized in this study was sorted as follows: $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ (23.82\%) $>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.92} \mathrm{Y}_{0.04} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.04} \mathrm{O}_{2} \quad(19.32 \%)>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.94} \mathrm{Y}_{0.03} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.03} \mathrm{O}_{2} \quad(18.36 \%)$ $>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Y}_{0.02} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.02} \mathrm{O}_{2}(17.10 \%)>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.98} \mathrm{Y}_{0.01} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.01} \mathrm{O}_{2}(15.75 \%)>\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ $(13.13 \%)$. The concentrations of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and Vo both increase with the increase of doping amount, as shown in Fig. 7. More $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$
crystal was reduced to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ to satisfy the charge balance due to the increased oxygen vacancy.

Raman spectroscopy is an analytical test method using Raman scattering effect. This method researches the scattering spectra of incident light with various frequencies, and thus obtains the message about molecular rotation and vibration, which is used to the research of molecular structure. Raman characterization provides important analysis for the formation about oxygen vacancy in ceria materials. Fig. 8(a) shows the Raman spectrum of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Pr}_{6} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ sample synthesized in this work. It can be observed that the strongest peak occurs at $-465 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ (denoted as $\mathrm{F}_{2 \mathrm{~g}}$ ), corresponding to the Raman active vibration mode. This peak is attributable to the oxygen ions' symmetrical stretching in the cerium tetrahedral structure. Thus, the structural symmetry of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is maintained. Therefore, if there are any gaps/defects in the structure, the peak will be very sensitive to these [62,63]. The doping of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+} / \mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ caused the distortion of the partial symmetry of the oxygen ion in the fluorite structure around the Ce ion, resulting in the formation of oxygen vacancy. The appearance of Raman peaks (denoted as $\alpha$ ) around $-560 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ were attributed to the production of external oxygen vacancies caused by charge neutral substitution of other trivalent rare earth cations into the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice as shown in the illustration in Fig. 8 (a). As shown in Fig. 8(b), the $\mathrm{I}_{\alpha} / \mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of all samples synthesized in this study was sorted as follows: $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2} \quad(0.61)$ $>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.92} \mathrm{Y}_{0.04} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.04} \mathrm{O}_{2} \quad(0.40) \quad>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.94} \mathrm{Y}_{0.03} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.03} \mathrm{O}_{2} \quad(0.31)$ $>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Y}_{0.02} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.02} \mathrm{O}_{2}(0.22)>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.98} \mathrm{Y}_{0.01} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.01} \mathrm{O}_{2}(0.11)>\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(0.03)$. Interestingly, this was the opposite of the trend in the size of samples. As we discussed earlier, co-doping decreased the size of cerium oxide samples, correspondingly increased the specific surface area, and the number of oxygen vacancy defects on the surface were increased, which was consistent with XPS test results.

Uv-vis spectroscopy is often applied to acquire the oxidation state information of metal oxides. The valence state information of Ce element in $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Pr}_{6} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives was preliminatively analyzed using UV-vis DRS diagram. As shown in Fig. 9(a), the absorption peak was $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ at the wavelength near 260 nm and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ at the wavelength near

340 nm , owing to the electron transition from O 2 p level to Ce 4 f level. With the increase of doping amount, the optical absorption intensity of the sample increases in the UV range, and the intensity of characteristic peaks belonging to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ increases. This can put down to the
increased concentration of oxygen vacancy in the sample. The results showed that co-doping strategy contributed to the increase of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration in abrasives, which had a positive influence on the improvement of abrasive polishing properties. In order to acquire the

Photocatalysis efficiency of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples for TC photodegradation (a), comparison of photodegradation percentage of TC (c), kinetic curves (b) and comparison of apparent rate constant of diverse photocatalysts (d) for TC photodegradation.
band-gap width ( $E g$ ) of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples, Schuster-Kubelka-Munk absorption function (ohv) and photon energy ( $h v$ ) were plotted as follows according to Eq. (3):
$(n h v)^{*}=\mathrm{K}\left(\mathrm{h} v-\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{g}}\right)$
Where $v$ is the vibration frequency, $h$ is Planck's constant, $\alpha$ is the absorption coefficient, $h v$ is the photon energy, and $K$ is the proportionality constant. The type of semiconductor determines the value of $\mathrm{n} . \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is the indirect transition semiconductor, so $n$ is equal to $1 / 2$. The rough band gap can be calibrated by measuring the X-intercept of the line, as shown in Fig. 9(b). The Eg of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}(\mathrm{x}=0.01,0.02,0.03,0.04$, 0.05) samples were equal to $2.61 \mathrm{eV}, 2.54 \mathrm{eV}, 2.36 \mathrm{eV}, 2.32 \mathrm{eV}$ and 2.28 eV , respectively. The $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples' band gap was narrowed in different degrees compared with the undoped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(E g=$ 3.05 eV ), which shows that the photocatalytic activity of the sample promotes by the growth of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+} / \mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ co-doping amount.

The photocatalytic performance of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives was characterized with the photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline TC. Fig. 10(a-d) shows the TC degradation curve and its pseudo-first-order kinetic curve. Before the photocatalytic experiment, dark adsorption was carried out for 60 min , so as to avert the influence of particle surface attach on TC degradation performance, and then ultraviolet irradiation was carried out. As shown in Fig. 10(a) and (c), after ultraviolet irradiation for 60 min , the photodegradation efficiency of TC solution was calculated as $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.90} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.02} \mathrm{O}_{2} \quad(77.75 \%) \quad>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.92} \mathrm{Y}_{0.04} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.04} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ (75.28\%) $>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.94} \mathrm{Y}_{0.03} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.02} \mathrm{O}_{2} \quad(73.35 \%) \quad>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Y}_{0.02} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.02} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ (71.45\%) $>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.98} \mathrm{Y}_{0.01} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.01} \mathrm{O}_{2}(67.74 \%)$. The reaction kinetic constants of TC photodegradation process can be computed as follows (4):
$k t=-\ln \left(\frac{C_{t}}{C_{0}}\right)$
Where, $k, t, C_{0}$ and $C_{t}$ are respectively the reaction kinetic constant, light irradiation time, initial concentration after dark adsorption and residual concentration under a certain irradiation time. As shown as Fig. 10(b) and (d), the k of the calculated samples was as follows: $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.90} \mathrm{Y}_{0.05}$ $\mathrm{Pr}_{0.05} \mathrm{O}_{2} \quad\left(0.0203 \mathrm{~min}^{-1}\right) \quad>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.92} \mathrm{Y}_{0.04} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.04} \mathrm{O}_{2} \quad\left(0.0183 \mathrm{~min}^{-1}\right)$ $>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.94} \mathrm{Y}_{0.03} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.03} \mathrm{O}_{2} \quad\left(0.0179 \mathrm{~min}^{-1}\right) \quad>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Y}_{0.02} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.02} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ $\left(0.0175 \mathrm{~min}^{-1}\right) \quad>\mathrm{Ce}_{0.98} \mathrm{Y}_{0.01} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.01} \mathrm{O}_{2} \quad\left(0.0170 \mathrm{~min}^{-1}\right) \quad>\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ $\left(0.0099 \mathrm{~min}^{-1}\right)$. The size of the cerium oxide sample was reduced, which increased the specific surface area and the photocatalytic active site. This ultimately allowed the photodegradation capacity of the cerium oxide photocatalyst to be improved by the co-doping strategy, which was the same as the results shown in the former UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Fig. 9).

The surface roughness of the material to be polished is one of the momentous parameters to estimate the polishing performance of the polishing slurry. Fig. 11(a)-(f) is the characterization of two-dimensional (2D) surface morphology of polished matrix after PCMP under atomic force microscopy, where the bright area represents the peak and the dark area represents the valley. Subsequently, the line profile roughness of the diagonal selection area in Fig. 11(a)-(f) was measured. As shown in Fig. 11(g), where the X-axis represents the length of the line profile and the Z-axis represents the depth of the line profile. The improvement of surface quality can be demonstrated by the reduction of line profile roughness. It can be seen that the rough peak and valley distribution of the polished surface of all quartz glass is more uniform than that of the unpolished original quartz glass surface, helping to improve the overall

surface quality. The graph in Fig. 12 showed the average surface roughness (Ra) of the polished quartz glass. The initial roughness of quartz glass was 1.08 nm . The surface quality of the polished matrix was greatly improved by applying the polishing slurry containing $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{Pr}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, and the surface roughness was memorably reduced compared with the control group. The introduction of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ reduced the Ra of polished quartz glass. With the further increase of doping amount, the roughness increased slightly. Among them, the Ra of polishing slurry prepared with $\mathrm{Ce}_{0.96} \mathrm{Y}_{0.03} \mathrm{Pr}_{0.02} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive was 0.36 nm . The specific reasons will be discussed later in the mechanism section.

The Removal rate $(R R)$ of the material is also a significant index to
appraise the polishing properties of polishing slurry. The bar chart in Fig. 12 represents the $R R$ of quartz glass after $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{Pr}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ nanoparticles polishing. Co-doping strategy increased the $R R$ of PCMP and decreased with further increase of doping amount. When the doping amount was 0.02 , the $R R$ of the abrasive was $932.42 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$. The change of abrasive $R R$ was mainly the synergistic effect of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration and particle size. When the doping amount was $0.02, \mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration and particle size reached a dynamic equilibrium in the research system of this experiment, thus making $R R$ reach the best in this work. Combined with the previous test results, we can conclude that in this work, the prepared $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{Pr}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive has the best PCMP performance when the single doping amount was 0.02 .

Cook [64] proposed that chemical-mechanical polishing is the grinding of the surface of the material due to the mechanical action of abrasive particles pressed into the surface of the workpiece along with the flow of polishing fluid (Fig. 13 (a)), and is coordinated with chemical action to achieve the purpose of material removal. Fig. 13 shows the PCMP mechanism of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{Pr}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive on quartz glass. In this study, the co-doping of $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ increased the content of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ on the surface of samples, reduced the band gap of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{Pr}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, enhanced the photocatalytic activity of abrasives, and further improved the material removal rate of abrasives, as can be seen in illustration (c) of Fig. 13 (b).

Under light irradiation, electrons transition from the valence band to the conduction band, producing $\mathrm{e}^{-} / \mathrm{h}^{+}$. In PCMP, $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{Pr}_{\mathrm{x}} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples absorb ultraviolet radiation to produce photogenerated charge carriers. $\mathrm{Y}^{3+} / \mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ co-doping narrowed the band gap of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ to 2.28 eV (Eg of pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ synthesized in this experiment was 3.05 eV ), and the photogenerated electron ( $\mathrm{e}^{-}$) was more likely to transition from valence band (VB) to conduction band (CB) after excitation, resulting in oxidation site $\left(\mathrm{h}^{+}\right)$in VB and reduction site ( $\mathrm{e}^{-}$) in CB. Form a photogenerated electron-hole pair ( $\mathrm{e}^{-} / \mathrm{h}^{+}$) [65], as can be seen in illustration (c) of

![img-13.jpeg](images\img-13.jpeg)

Fig. 13. PCMP mechanism diagram of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples.

Fig. 13 (b). The photo-biogenic carrier can react with the surrounding medium to form oxidizing active groups, such as superoxide free radicals $\left(-\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}\right)$, hydroxyl free radicals $\left(-\mathrm{OH}\right), \mathrm{h}^{+}$, etc. These oxidizing active groups leads to better degradation of materials [65]. $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ will produce impurity levels in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ gap, which will reduce the gap width. The purpose of this strategy is to form a receptor layer below CB of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ to facilitate the downward flow of electrons from $\mathrm{CeO}_{2} \mathrm{CB}$ to the doping layer, thereby inhibiting the recombination of photogenerated carriers. After doping $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$ in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice, we reason, the exposed $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ portion is replaced by $\mathrm{Y}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Pr}^{3+}$. The oxygen vacancy can efficiently trap electrons in CB and limit the rate of photogenerated carrier recombination in $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$, as shown by chemical Eqs. (1) (3) in the Fig. 13 (b). Therefore, $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ samples have good photocatalytic activity.
$\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate and -OH in the polishing slurry contact and hydration reaction occurs, Si-OH bond is formed on the surface of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ substrate, and $\mathrm{Si}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ hydration layer is generated, as shown by chemical Eq. (4) in the Fig. 13 (b) [6]. These active substances in the polish are thought to provide additional strong oxidation activity, which accelerates the production of chemical reaction layers. It is generally believed that the increase in the chemical reactivity of the slurry helps the surface of the quartz glass to be polished, forming a hydration layer that is faster and easier to remove, thus improving $R R$ [40]. At the same time, the surface of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is dissociated by $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to form an -OH group, and silicate ions are
adsorbed to the surface of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ through the interaction with the -OH group, as shown by chemical equation (5) in the Fig. 13 (b). The chemistry of the material removal process in $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ chemical-mechanical polishing depends on the interaction between the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ layer and samples on the surface and the water and chemical agent in the polishing slurry [64].

In this study, $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions can be used as the active site on the surface of cerium oxide and react with the glass surface to form Ce-O-Si bonds, as shown by chemical equation (6) in the Fig. 13 (b). The new bond is stronger than the Si-O-Si bond on the surface of molten silica. Under the action of the mechanical force applied by the polishing machine. Si-O-Si bond is broken. Remove the polished quartz glass surface. In the case of polishing silica, it is generally believed that the high concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ on the surface of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive is the reason for its high reactivity with the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ matrix. It was covered in literature [29, 33, 40, 66-72] that $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives rich in $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ obtained significant removal capacity, which may be due to the enhanced tribological chemical activity to the quartz glass (accelerates the becoming of Ce-O-Si bonds). The $R R$ of the prepared $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive was obviously improved under PCMP conditions, which may be due to the enhanced photocatalytic activity of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{x} \mathrm{Pr}_{x} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ polishing slurry under UV irradiation and the appropriate particle size.

In this work, abrasives with relatively uniform particle size distribution and an average size of around 240 nm exhibit excellent PCMP

properties due to having more active sites. As shown in the bottom half of the Fig. 13 (b), large particle size can promote the improvement of $R R$, but it is not friendly to improve its photocatalytic ability, so the softening layer cannot be quickly generated [42,43,53]. The chemical reaction rate of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based particle cannot keep up with the mechanical removal rate. At the same time, due to excessive polishing, the surface of the workpiece to be polished will be scratched and worn, which will affect the surface quality of the material. On the contrary, small particle size can improve the photocatalytic performance, but has no advantage in mechanical removal rate, thus reducing $R R$ and increasing time cost.

## 4. Conclusions

In this work, a series of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Pr}_{6} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasives with normal octahedral shape were synthesized and applied to PCMP as functional abrasives. PCMP results show that a smooth surface with low roughness can be obtained. As expected, the grinding rate of $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Pr}_{6} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive improved by approximately $87.10 \%$ compared to the undoped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive. $\mathrm{Y} / \mathrm{Pr}$ co-doping improved the separation efficiency of the photogenic carrier of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particle photocatalyst, and enhanced the photochemical oxidation activity. This further promoted the generation of oxidizing active substances ( $\cdot \mathrm{OH}, \cdot \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{~h}^{\circ}$, etc.) in the polishing slurry. Therefore, the formation and removal of chemical reactions in the soft layer are accelerated. The $\mathrm{Ce}_{1-2 x} \mathrm{Y}_{4} \mathrm{Pr}_{6} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ abrasive prepared in this study had the advantages of reducing surface roughness and increasing removal velocity, and was suitable for various CMP, PCMP, and application fields. This study is well on the way to providing a new approach and experimental basis for the design and synthesis of cerium specialized abrasives.
