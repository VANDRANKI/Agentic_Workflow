## A B STRACT

This study explores the effects of atomic-level factors on the performance of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ when interacting with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ films. It specifically examines how different precursors, the ratio of Ce to OH , and reaction temperatures influence outcomes. Our findings reveal that smaller particles, around 5 nm in size, created using a $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursor, are more effective at removing $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ films compared to larger, more crystalline particles from a $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursor. This is due to their increased interaction with the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film during the polishing process, challenging the conventional emphasis on mechanical abrasion in chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) and highlighting the crucial role of chemical interactions. Further analysis through FT-IR and TGA-FTIR techniques showed distinct functional group profiles on the ceria surfaces. Ceria derived from $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ exhibited a higher presence of OH and $\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ groups, enhancing adsorption capabilities, as verified by CHN analysis. Importantly, first-principles calculations identified these surface groups as key to improving adhesion to $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ films. Surfaces of amorphous $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, rich in -OH and $-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ groups, showed significantly higher adhesion levels than their crystalline counterparts, connecting crystallinity to chemical functionality. This new insight leads to the possibility of designing next-generation $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives with increased chemical activity.

## 1. Introduction

The emergence and growth of new technologies, such as autonomous driving, artificial intelligence (AI), 5G communications, the Internet of Things (IoT), and large-scale data processing, have significantly advanced semiconductor technologies [1,2]. To keep pace with these advancing technologies, DRAM and NAND technologies continue to be innovated to achieve higher density, reduced power consumption, and faster speeds beyond the current node [1,2].

Chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) continues to be a critical technology in advancing semiconductor device development, as it aims to achieve high polishing rates, selective removal, uniformity across the wafer and die, and minimal CMP-induced defects and scratches [3-5]. Ceria-based CMP slurries have been widely used for polishing various types of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}, \mathrm{Si}_{3} \mathrm{~N}_{4}$, and other related dielectric films due to their high oxide removal rates (RRs) and selectivity, particularly in the formation of shallow trench isolation (STI) structures [6-9]. Recent advancements in particle technology have driven innovation in ceria-based CMP slurry
development, enabling the fabrication of smaller geometries and complex schemes. However, as feature sizes continue to shrink, reducing the formation of scratches and defects on wafer surfaces during polishing remains a challenge. There is currently a significant demand for ceria particles that are smaller than 10 nm [10], as they have the potential to meet the highly demanding new requirements for defect reduction. These smaller ceria particles are known as superfine $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles.

Only a few papers have reported on the synthesis of superfine $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles for CMP applications [11,12]. The approach taken by the published papers involves preparing $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ particles that are less than 10 nm in diameter, which differs significantly from the traditional approach used to prepare well-crystalline $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles for $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ CMP. The degree of crystallinity and particle size of ceria are known to affect the oxide removal rate. However, it has been observed that despite having relatively low degrees of crystallinity, $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ particles demonstrate a high rate of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film removal. T. Iwano et al. reported that superfine ceria particles containing $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{OH})_{n} \mathrm{X}_{b}\left(\mathrm{X}=\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}\right.$and $\left.\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}\right)$ [11], in which the anions can activate a Ce atom to improve the

reactivity of $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ particles, lead to higher $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ RRs. Later, Y. Son et al. suggested that the larger total contact area of smaller $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ particles during polishing results in a higher $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film polishing rate [12], which was referred to as the contact-area-based CMP mechanism. Despite the aforementioned studies, the fundamental reasons behind the high oxide removal rate observed in superfine $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles with low crystallinity remain unclear. Gaining insight into this matter is important, given the substantial investments of time and effort still being made in the utilization of smaller and highly crystalline $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles.

Superfine $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles are typically synthesized through the precipitation method [11,12], which involves preparing Ce precursors, followed by their precipitation through -OH group reactions and transformation into $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles. Although this method is simple, cost-effective, and easily scalable, the physicochemical properties of the resulting particles can be affected by various synthesis parameters, including pH , temperature, additives, and the types and concentrations of reactants [13,14]. Our hypothesis is that a combination of these parameters plays a crucial role in determining the properties of superfine ceria particles, including their polishing behaviors. Key synthesis parameters can influence the crystallization process, including nanocrystal nucleation, growth, and aggregation into $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ and/or $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ crystals, as well as the rate of dissolution of non-stable structures [11-14].

In this study, we investigated how various parameters, including the types of Ce precursors, the concentration of the precipitation agents, reaction pH , and temperature, impact the properties of superfine $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles and their polishing behaviors. To gain a deeper understanding of the mechanism underlying $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film removal by superfine $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles, we conducted computational simulations based on density functional theory (DFT). Gaining a comprehensive understanding of superfine $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles and their impact on CMP performance is crucial for optimizing synthesis techniques and offering direction in designing and producing superfine $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles for advanced device CMP applications.

## 2. Experimental

### 2.1. Materials

Cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate $\left(\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$, ammonium cerium (IV) nitrate $\left(\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{6}\right)$, and ammonium hydroxide $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}\right)$ were sourced from Sigma Aldrich. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was acquired from Polysciences, Inc. Additionally, 2000 nm-thick oxide films, which were deposited on 200 mm diameter Si wafers using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition with tetraethyl orthosilicate (PETEOS), were procured from DK Nanotechnology.

### 2.2. Preparation of superfine $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles and the slurry preparation

Superfine ceria particles were synthesized using $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3}$ and $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{6}$ as precursors for $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ions, respectively. This was achieved through a precipitation method at room temperature (RT) and $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. We prepared solutions of $0.1 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3}$ and $0.1 \mathrm{M}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{Ce}$ $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{6}$ in deionized (DI) water, which were then mixed with $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}$. This resulted in the formation of superfine ceria particles. $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}$ was incrementally added to the solution, maintaining varying molar ratios of Ce ion to $\mathrm{OH}^{-}(1: 1,1: 2,1: 3,1: 4$, and 1:5). The initial phase of the reaction was conducted at RT for 12 h , following which the particles were collected. To explore the effects of temperature, the reaction temperature was then increased to $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and the process was continued for an additional 6 h . No significant changes were observed when stirring was extended beyond this duration. The synthesized particles were then washed with DI water and centrifuged until their conductivity was reduced to less than $1.5 \mu \mathrm{~S} / \mathrm{cm}$, ensuring the removal of residual ions.

For slurry preparation, the synthesized particles were dispersed in DI water at a concentration of $0.2 \mathrm{wt} \%$. Additionally, $0.2 \mathrm{wt} \%$ PVA was added as a stabilizing agent. The pH of the slurries was then adjusted to 6
using either $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ or KOH .

### 2.3. Material characterization

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the ceria particles were examined using a Bruker D8 Advance instrument. For identifying the surface functional groups of these particles, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed utilizing the Nicolet iS10 from Thermo Scientific. Also, Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) was coupled with FT-IR for continuous evolved gas analysis. This was conducted at a heating rate of $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C} / \mathrm{min}$ in a nitrogen atmosphere, using a Nicolet iS50 equipped with a derivative thermogravimetry detector and an IR cell, also from Thermo Fisher Scientific. TGA-FTIR measurements were taken up to $700{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and the FT-IR spectra were analyzed using OMNIC software.

The CHN contents in the as-synthesized ceria particles were quantified using an elemental analyzer (Model 2400(II)) from PerkinElmer. Absorbance spectra were recorded with a UV-visible spectrometer (Lambda 35, PerkinElmer) in the 200-500 nm wavelength range, with samples placed in a 1.0 cm long quartz cuvette. Additionally, Raman spectroscopy was employed to examine the ceria particles using a Nicolet DXR Raman Microscope from Thermo Scientific. This analysis spanned a wavelength range of $400-1600 \mathrm{~nm}$, with the samples prepared as solid dried powders on a glass slide.

The morphological characterization (shape and size distribution) of ceria particles was performed using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEM-2010). High-resolution spectra of Ce 3d and O 1s for the synthesized ceria particles were acquired through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at the Cornell Center for Materials Research. The data from this analysis was processed using XPSPEAK-4.1 software.

### 2.4. Chemical mechanical planarization

The 8 -inch blank $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ wafers were polished for 1 min using a POLI500 polisher from G\&P Technology at 93/87 rpm platen/carrier speed, 3 psi down-pressure, and a slurry flow rate of $150 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. The IC-1000 Dupont polishing pad was conditioned ex-situ with a 3M A63 diamond conditioner. The thickness of the films was determined by measuring them with an interferometer (FilmTek 2000, Bruker) before and after polishing at 48 points across the diameter of the 200 mm wafer. This process was repeated with two different wafers to ensure accuracy, and the average values of these measurements are presented in this report.

### 2.5. Computational details

DFT as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) was used to conduct first-principles calculations [15]. We employed a spin-polarized DFT + U methodology [16], adopting a Hubbard parameter of 5.0 eV to accurately describe the nature of the 4 f electrons of Ce. Additionally, we incorporated the dispersion correction (DFT-D2) proposed by Grimme [17] to address the long-range van der Waals interactions.

In our calculations, we used a plane wave basis set, setting the cut-off energy at 450 eV . To address both core and valence electrons, the Projector Augmented Wave (PAW) method was employed. For the exchange-correlation function, our approach involved the use of the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), specifically following the formulation by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE).

The amorphous $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ model structure was derived from its crystalline form using a melt-quenching technique, a process part of our ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. We used a $4 \times 4 \times 1$ supercell of the crystalline $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ structure, which was annealed at a high temperature of 5000 K for 5 ps using a time step of 1 fs . To enable local structural rearrangements, the initial structure was expanded to $110 \%$ of its original ground state volume. Subsequently, the samples underwent a rapid quenching process to a temperature of 298 K at a cooling

rate of $2.0 \mathrm{~K} / \mathrm{fs}$. This step was followed by both volume and geometric optimization. For the AIMD simulations, the Brillouin zone sampling was confined to the gamma point. However, for static energy calculations, a denser k-point mesh of $2 \times 2 \times 1$, as per the Monkhorst-Pack scheme [18], was utilized.

For the calculation of surface interactions between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$, a $4 \times 4 \times 1 \mathrm{k}$-point grid was utilized for integrations across the Brillouin zone. The dimensions of the supercell were set to an $11.5 \AA \times 13.3 \AA \times$ $32.3 \AA$. The cutoff energy for the plane wave was set at 450 eV in the reciprocal area, with a smearing width of 0.2 eV . Furthermore, the convergence criterion for the self-consistent field was set at $10^{-5} \mathrm{eV}$. To determine the $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}$ bonding distance between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$, energy calculations were based on a structure achieved through sufficient thermodynamic stabilization. In this study, all supercell models were transformed into crystallographic data using the VESTA software (version 3.5.8). The conversion process utilized CONTCAR files, which were obtained from DFT calculations.

## 3. Results and discussion

3.1. Impact of types of Ce precursors $\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right.$ and $\left.\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}\right)$, concentrations of precipitation agents, and the reaction temperature on the physicochemical properties of superfine ceria particles

Fig. 1 presents the XRD results of superfine ceria particles synthesized using $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3}$ and $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{6}$ as $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursors, respectively. These particles were prepared with varying molar ratios of Ce precursors to the precipitating agent, ranging from 1:1 to 1:5, at both RT and $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The XRD patterns reveal that all as-synthesized samples exhibit peaks consistent with the face-centered cubic $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ structure (JCPDS-34-0394). Notably, superfine ceria particles derived from Ce $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3}$ (Fig. 1a) demonstrate significantly higher crystallinity compared to those synthesized from $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{6}$ (Fig. 1b), irrespective of the reaction temperature. This suggests that the type of Ce precursors has a marked influence on the crystallinity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$.

Table 1 summarizes the crystallite size $\left(\mathrm{d}_{\text {XRD }}\right)$, lattice parameter, and crystallinity values for two sets of superfine ceria particles, calculated from Fig. 1. Overall, samples prepared with the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ precursor exhibit larger crystallite sizes than those prepared with the $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursor. Specifically, ceria particles synthesized with the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ precursor have a $\mathrm{d}_{\text {XRD }}$ range of $6.8-13.5 \mathrm{~nm}$, whereas those synthesized with the $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursor range from 4.9 nm to 6.6 nm across both temperature conditions (Table I). The TEM images of the ceria particles are shown in Fig. S2. These images reveal that the particle sizes are consistent with the crystalline sizes, indicating that the particles are primarily composed of single crystals. Furthermore, the crystallinity of the ceria particles also varies depending on the precursors and the $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{OH}$ ratio, with
samples prepared with $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ precursor exhibiting higher crystallinity ( 85 $\pm 1 \%$ ) compared to those prepared with $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursor ( $64 \pm 1 \%$ ) (Table I).

The question arises as to why the crystallite size and crystallinity values significantly differ based on the chosen precursors and the $\mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{OH}$ ratio in the synthesis of superfine ceria particles. As described in the experimental section, 0.1 M solutions of $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3}$ and $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{6}$ were prepared in DI water and mixed with $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}$ in varying molar ratios of Ce ion to $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to prepare the superfine ceria particles.

For the samples derived from the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ precursor, the addition of $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}$ to the $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3}$ solution resulted in a noticeable color change (Fig. S1). Initially, the solution transitioned from colorless to dark gray and finally settled into a pale yellow (Fig. S1). This color change with Ce $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3}$ is likely due to precipitation followed by dehydration/oxidation reactions, which are influenced by dissolved oxygen in the solution and at the air-liquid interface [14]. Dark gray $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}$ precipitates form as $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions react with $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}$ [14]. In the air, $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}$ is unstable and oxidizes to $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ when stirred vigorously in the presence of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ [14].
$2 \mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{2}(\mathrm{aq})+6 \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}(\mathrm{~s})+6 \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{NO}_{3}(\mathrm{aq})+1 /$ $2 \mathrm{O}_{2}$
$\rightarrow 2 \mathrm{CeO}_{2}(\mathrm{~s})+3 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+6 \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{NO}_{3}(\mathrm{aq})$
In the case of the samples derived from the $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursor, the addition of $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}$ to the transparent orange $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{6}$ solution resulted in a precipitation reaction, forming yellow $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ (Fig. S1). The color of the precipitate remained constant throughout the subsequent dehydration process (Fig. S1), which converts $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ to $\mathrm{CeO}_{2} \cdot 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. This consistency in color is indicative of the fact that the oxidation state of Ce does not change during this transformation.
$\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \cdot \mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{6}(\mathrm{aq})+4 \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}(\mathrm{aq}) \rightarrow \mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}(\mathrm{~s})$ or $\mathrm{CeO}_{2} \cdot 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(\mathrm{s})$ $+6 \mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{NO}_{3}(\mathrm{aq})$

The distinct color changes and chemical behaviors observed in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles synthesized from $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursors [14] suggest that the initial oxidation state of Ce and the specific reaction pathway have a significant impact on the final properties of the superfine ceria particles. The nucleation and growth of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles in the precursor solution are critical stages that are significantly influenced by various synthesis conditions such as the concentration of the cerium precursors, precipitants, reaction temperature, and process duration [13]. Our experiments, conducted at both RT and $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with varying molar ratios of Ce precursor to -OH , indicate that the type of Ce precursors is an important factor in defining the crystalline quality of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles, as shown in Fig. 1. Higher crystal quality is typically associated with slower nucleation rates, allowing more time for particle growth [19-21]. This slow growth enables particles to develop a more orderly and

well-defined crystal structure, thereby enhancing crystallinity. In contrast, rapid growth, indicative of faster nucleation rates, may not provide sufficient time for particles to properly arrange themselves, leading to a less organized structure and lower crystallinity.

According to classical nucleation theory [19], the degree of supersaturation is a key factor in determining the nucleation rate. Supersaturation is especially critical as high levels can lead to the formation of non-equilibrium phases or amorphous regions, reducing crystal quality [19]. The relationship between the solubility of Ce precursors and supersaturation can be described mathematically. For instance, the solubility of different Ce ion species in water is given by the equations: $\mathrm{S}=$ $\left[\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right] / \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{sp}}$ and $\mathrm{S}=\left[\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}\right]\left[\mathrm{OH}^{-}\right] / \mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{sp}}$ where S represents supersaturation and $\mathrm{K}_{\text {sp }}$ is the solubility constant for $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{OH})_{4}$ respectively. The solubility of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions $\left(\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{sp}}=1.6 \times 10^{-20}\right)$ is significantly higher than that of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ions $\left(\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{sp}}=2 \times 10^{-48}\right)$ [22]. This higher solubility and surface energy of smaller $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{OH})_{3}$ particles, present during the synthesis of superfine ceria particles from $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions, lead to their redissolution and subsequent incorporation into well-structured ceria particles. Conversely, the very low solubility of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ solutions may contribute to reduced crystallinity due to higher supersaturation and a faster nucleation rate associated with $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$.

### 3.1.1. $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film removal rates using $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based CMP slurries

Fig. 2 presents a comparative analysis of the removal rates of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ films using $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based CMP slurries, prepared with $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursors under varying OH molar ratios and temperatures. A key
![img-1.jpeg](images\img-1.jpeg)

Fig. 2. $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film removal rates using slurry comprising $0.2 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles derived from $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursors with varying molar ratios of Ce precursor to -OH. Note: The slurries were adjusted to pH 6.0 . There was no precipitation at a $1: 1 \mathrm{M}$ ratio of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to -OH .
observation from this data is that slurries synthesized from the $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursor demonstrate higher removal rates compared to those derived from the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ precursor. It is well-understood in CMP processes that larger particles typically contribute to higher removal rates due to their mechanical abrasive action, whereas smaller particles facilitate removal primarily through chemical action. In our study, despite the smaller size ( 5 nm ) of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$-derived superfine particles, they exhibit a higher removal rate than those derived from the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ precursor. This observation highlights the significant role of chemical action, possibly influenced by the surface chemistries present on the superfine ceria particles.

### 3.1.2. Surface chemistry of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$-derived $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles

FT-IR spectra of superfine $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles synthesized using $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursors are shown in Fig. 3. Notable peaks in the 500-700, 1025, 1380, and $1425 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ regions correspond to Ce-O stretching vibrations, Ce-O-Ce stretching bands [23], $-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ species [7], and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$[24] species, respectively. A band at $1630 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ is related to the bending mode of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The -OH stretching bands of all superfine ceria particles are detected in the range of $3200-3600 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ (data not shown).

Significant differences in adsorption characteristics are observed between $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$-derived superfine ceria particles, particularly in the absorption peaks associated with $-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ species on ceria surfaces. The $-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ species peak in the particles from $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ reduces as the molar ratio of Ce ions to $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$increases (Fig. 3a), disappearing entirely beyond a $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ to $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$molar ratio of 1:2. It is known that $-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ groups gradually decrease as the reaction pH increases, being fully replaced by OH groups at a pH above 10.5. Interestingly, all superfine ceria particles generated from $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ show a $-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ species peak (Fig. 3b), even though they were prepared under alkaline conditions, indicating an enhanced adsorption capacity for $-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ species. Compared to - OH concentration and reaction pH , the reaction temperature has a relatively minor effect on the adsorption of $-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ species on ceria surfaces under the conditions we were interested in.

Anionic species such as $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$and $\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}$can interact with surface Ce sites through electrostatic and coordination bonds. Both Ce sites ( $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ) on ceria surfaces can act as Lewis acids, accepting electron pairs from Lewis bases such as $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$and $\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}$species [25-27]. The amorphous regions in ceria particles with low crystallinity, prepared by $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, can increase the number of surface acidic sites. These include $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ sites and O vacancies, potentially enhancing the adsorption of $-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ species on the ceria surface during particle synthesis. The amorphous region has non-ideal coordination numbers between Ce and O atoms, while the crystalline region has Ce and O coordination numbers of 8 and 4 , respectively. The less organized structure and reduced crystallinity of superfine ceria, derived from $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ compared to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$, likely lead to an increased number of Lewis acid sites. This increase promotes interactions with anionic species like $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$and $\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}$. As a result, superfine ceria particles with low crystallinity originating from $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ show higher adsorption capacities for $\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-}$species.

Our findings from XRD, FT-IR, and CMP results consistently demonstrate that the selection of Ce precursors plays a crucial in the formation of superfine ceria particles and significantly influences their

CMP performances. To focus our research more effectively, we concentrated exclusively on studying superfine ceria samples prepared using a molar ratio of $1: 2$ for both $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ to $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$.

Fig. 4 a and b shows 3D in-situ IR spectra, capturing the evolving gas emissions from ceria across a temperature range of $50-700{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Initially, minor peaks appear in the absorption bands from 3500 to $3960 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ at $50{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}[28,29]$, which are accompanied by bands between 2300 and $2400 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ [28,29]. These bands are attributed to water vapor and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, respectively, and are observed consistently throughout the examined temperature range. Notably, The peak associated with $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ increases in intensity over the temperature spectrum, reaching its highest peak around $270{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ before decreasing again. The presence of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ formation suggests that it may either originate from the surrounding atmosphere or result from the oxidation and/or decomposition of hydrocarbon impurities on the ceria particles. Elemental analysis supports this assumption, revealing carbon concentrations of $0.65 \%$ and $0.61 \%$ in ceria particles derived from $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, respectively, as indicated in Table 2.

New peaks at 1598 and $1630 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, observed at $300{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in the $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ derived ceria particles (Fig. 4c), are associated with the formation of nitric dioxide $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{2}\right)$ from the ceria surface [30,31]. This formation is a result of the decomposition of the $\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ group (Fig. 3b). The TG analysis profile (Fig. 4d) indicates that $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$-derived ceria particles have $11 \%$ weight loss, which is significantly higher than the $3 \%$ loss in $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$-derived particles, possibly due to higher densities of the surface functional group.

The surface functional group densities of superfine ceria particles were determined through CHN analysis. Up to temperatures of $700{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the gases evolved from the surface consisting only of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$, as shown in Fig. 4a-c. The densities of their surface functional groups were calculated under the assumption that they are composed exclusively of groups related to $\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{C}$, and N (e.g., $\mathrm{OH}, \mathrm{CH}_{3}, \mathrm{NO}_{3}$ ), as shown in

Figs. 3 and 4. Initially, H was considered for $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ based on the concentration of C , and any remaining H was presumed to contribute to OH . $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$-derived $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles contained $0.61 \% \mathrm{C}$ and $0.23 \% \mathrm{H}$ with surface densities of $3.52 \mathrm{~nm}^{2}$ for $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ groups and $15.91 \mathrm{~nm}^{2}$ for OH groups. In contrast, $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$-derived $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles had $0.65 \% \mathrm{C}, 0.62 \% \mathrm{H}$, and $1.34 \% \mathrm{~N}$, with surface densities of $2.10 \mathrm{~nm}^{2}$ for $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ groups, 24.08 $\mathrm{nm}^{2}$ for OH groups, and $3.72 \mathrm{~nm}^{2}$ for $\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ groups. The presence of $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ groups in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles could be attributed to impurities during their synthesis, as similar concentrations were found in both types of ceria particles. The higher density of OH groups on the $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$-derived $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles, along with the presence of $\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ groups, might be one of the reasons for the higher $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ removal rates seen with $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$-derived $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles.

The surface $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles are known to be highly reactive [32-34], playing a crucial role in achieving high removal rates of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ films during CMP. To assess this, UV-vis spectra of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles prepared using two different precursors were analyzed to evaluate the oxygen-metal ion charge-transfer bands of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles, as illustrated in Fig. 5a. $\mathrm{CaO}_{2}$ particles exhibit two absorption peaks centered at 255 and 285 nm , which correspond to $\mathrm{O}^{2-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{O}^{2-} \rightarrow \mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ charge-transfer [35], respectively. Notably, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles prepared with the $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursor show a higher absorption peak at 255 nm (Fig. 5a), indicating a higher surface concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions.

When an oxygen vacancy $\left(\mathrm{O}_{v}\right)$ is created in the lattice, it typically leaves behind two electrons, often resulting in the formation of two $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions near the vacancy. The amorphous phase of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ tends to form $\mathrm{O}_{v}$ more readily, with a lower formation energy of 1.70 eV [36], compared to crystalline $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(3.32 \mathrm{eV})$. Consequently, the low crystalline phase of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ can exhibit a higher concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ ions on its surface, characterized by a lower surface energy of $0.92 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ and a lower surface oxygen vacancy formation energy of 1.20 eV [36].

The surface densities of $\mathrm{CH}_{3}, \mathrm{OH}$, and $\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ groups were determined using the element contents from CHN analysis. The calculation formula is Functional groups $\mathrm{nm}^{-2}=a \times \mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{a}} /\left(\mathrm{M} \times \mathrm{S} \times 10^{20}\right)$ where a (\%) represents the elemental content derived from CHN analysis, $\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{a}}$ is Avogadro's number ( $6.02 \times$ $10^{23}$ ), M is the molar mass of the total elements in the respective functional group, and $\mathrm{S}=\mathrm{dd}^{2} /\left(\mathrm{d}^{2} \mathrm{p}\right)=6 /(\mathrm{d} \rho)$ where d is the average particle size, which is 10 nm for $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$-driven $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and 5 nm for $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$-driven $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, respectively. The $\rho$ represents the bulk density of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, which is $7.65 \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$.

particles with low crystallinity synthesized by $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ display a higher $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration than those produced using $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ (Fig. 1), most of the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ sites in the $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$-derived particles are bound to -OH and $-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ on the ceria surface. This observation draws attention to the importance of understanding how the functional groups present on the ceria surface impact their interaction with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$. This understanding is crucial for comprehending the overall CMP performance of these superfine $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles.

### 3.1.3. Interfacial adhesion properties of $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ on crystalline and amorphous $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces

The functional groups present in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles derived from $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursors show notable differences, which significantly affect how they interact with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surfaces during the CMP process. To better understand these interactions, we conducted a theoretical study examining the interfacial adhesion properties of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces. Our research concentrated on various species observed, including the $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{x}}, \mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{v}},-\mathrm{OH}$ groups, and $-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ groups on the ceria surface. We focused specifically on
examining amorphous structures, rather than less organized forms, and compared their properties to those of crystalline structures.

Fig. 7 shows the adhesion work $\left(W_{\text {ad }}\right)$ at the interfaces between $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and two different $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces: the crystalline ( $\mathrm{cCeO}_{2}$ ) and the amorphous ( $\mathrm{aCeO}_{2}$ ) forms, each with various surface functional groups such as $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{x}}, \mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{v}},-\mathrm{OH}$ groups, and $-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ groups. $W_{\text {ad }}$ quantifies the bond strength between two surfaces. It is calculated by subtracting the total energy of the individual materials ( $E_{\mathrm{SiO} 2}$ and $E_{\mathrm{CeO} 2}$ ) from the combined interface energy ( $E_{\mathrm{SiO} 2 / \mathrm{CeO} 2}$ ) and then dividing this difference by the contact area $(A)$, as per the formula: $W_{\text {ad }}=\left(E_{\mathrm{SiO} 2}+E_{\mathrm{CeO} 2}-E_{\mathrm{SiO} 2 / \mathrm{CeO} 2}\right) /$ A. Here, $E_{\mathrm{SiO} 2}$ and $E_{\mathrm{CeO} 2}$ are the energies of the individual supercell slabs, while $E_{\mathrm{SiO} 2 / \mathrm{CeO} 2}$ represents the total energy when a Ce-O-Si bond forms between the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ interfaces.

According to Fig. 7a, the $W_{\text {ad }}$ values for interfaces between $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and $c \mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{L}}$ and -OH groups ( $\mathrm{cCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{OH}$ ) are $0.50 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$. The presence of $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{v}}$ increases this value to $0.58 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$, suggesting a stronger bond with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ due to the high reactivity from these vacancies. The interface with $\mathrm{cCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ exhibits the highest affinity to the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surface, with a $W_{\text {ad }}$

![img-6.jpeg](images\img-6.jpeg)

Fig. 7. Simulation models depicting the work of adhesion ( $\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{ad}}$ ) between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$, showcasing two different scenarios: (a) with crystalline $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and (b) with amorphous $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. Both models include $\mathrm{O}_{x}, \mathrm{O}_{y},-\mathrm{OH}$ groups, and $-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ groups. In these models, green spheres represent $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ions, blue spheres depict $\mathrm{Si}^{4+}$ ions, red spheres are used to indicate $\mathrm{O}^{2-}$ ions, and silver spheres denote N ions. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)
value of $1.01 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$.
Conversely, $\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{ad}}$ values at the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2} / \mathrm{aCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{aCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{OH}$ interfaces were recorded at $0.73 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ and $0.75 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$, respectively, indicating that the amorphous structure's increased surface reactivity significantly strengthens the interface. The introduction of $\mathrm{O}_{3}$ decreases these values to $0.60 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$. Among the materials studied, $\mathrm{aCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ exhibits the highest affinity towards the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ surface, with a $W_{\text {ad }}$ of 2.40 $\mathrm{J} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$.

When the particles exhibit high crystallinity, $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ sites ( $\mathrm{cCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{O}_{x}$ ) show elevated $W_{\text {ad }}$ values for $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$, which correlates with the role of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ as active sites for enhancing $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ removal rates. Although we did not detect the $\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ group in our highly crystalline $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ derived by $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ precursors (Fig. 4 and Table 2), modifying $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles with $\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ groups could potentially increase their affinity for $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$, thereby improving the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film removal rate. Interestingly, our DFT simulations reveal that $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ sites $\left(\mathrm{aCeO}_{2}-\mathrm{O}_{x}\right)$ have the lowest work of adhesion, suggesting these may not be active sites in amorphous regions. In contrast, our less crystalline $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles derived from $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursors contain higher concentrations of $-\mathrm{OH}$ and $-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ groups (Fig. 4 and Table 2) and exhibit higher $W_{\text {ad }}$ values. These groups are likely the active sites in low crystalline $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles for $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ CMP. It is important to note that overall bonds between $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{aCeO}_{2}$ are much stronger than those with $c \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. The highly reactive surface of the amorphous
regions might explain the increased efficiency of CMP processes using low crystalline $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles, which have high densities of OH and $\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ groups on their surface. Consequently, low crystalline ceria could lead to more effective $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ removal in CMP applications due to its stronger interactions with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ films.

## 4. Conclusions

In conclusion, we demonstrated the profound impact of Ce precursors $\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right.$ and $\left.\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}\right), \mathrm{Ce} / \mathrm{OH}$ molar ratios, and reaction temperatures on the physicochemical properties of superfine $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles. Our XRD results clearly show that superfine ceria particles derived from the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ precursor $\left(\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3}\right)$ have larger crystallite sizes and higher crystallinity compared to those synthesized from the $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursor $\left(\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{Ce}\right.$ $\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{6}$ ). This difference is attributed to their reaction pathways and solubility characteristics of the precursors, which significantly influence the nucleation and growth processes of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles.

Surprisingly, the $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$-derived particles, with their smaller size (around 5 nm ), demonstrated superior $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ film removal rates compared to the larger $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$-derived particles. This finding emphasizes the role of chemical action in the CMP process, challenging the traditional belief that larger particles primarily drive higher removal rates due to mechanical abrasion.

FT-IR and TGA analyses further reveal distinct surface chemistry profiles between the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$-derived ceria particles. The presence and density of various functional groups on the particle surfaces, as evidenced by CHN analysis, show different adsorption behaviors. Particularly, $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$-derived particles exhibit a higher adsorption capacity for $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ species, likely due to their lower crystallinity and the increased number of surface acidic sites. Notably, $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$-derived particles demonstrate a higher weight loss of $11 \%$ compared to $3 \%$ in $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$-derived particles, indicative of their distinct surface functional group compositions. The $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$-derived particles contain $0.65 \% \mathrm{C}, 0.62 \% \mathrm{H}$, and 1.34 $\% \mathrm{~N}$, with a higher density of OH groups $\left(24.08 \mathrm{~nm}^{2}\right)$ and the presence of $\mathrm{NO}_{2}$ groups $\left(3.72 \mathrm{~nm}^{2}\right)$, compared to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$-derived particles which contain $0.61 \% \mathrm{C}$ and $0.23 \% \mathrm{H}$, with a lower OH group density ( 15.91 $\mathrm{nm}^{2}$ ).

Through detailed theoretical and DFT analyses, we have shown that the nature and concentration of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ functional groups, derived from both $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ precursors, critically impact the work of adhesion with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$. Our results distinctly reveal that $a \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ surfaces generally exhibit higher $W_{\text {ad }}$ values with $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ compared to their $c \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. Specifically, $W_{\text {ad }}$ values for $\mathrm{SiO}_{2} / a \mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{L}}$ and $a \mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{OH}$ interfaces were $0.73 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ and $0.75 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$, respectively, compared to $0.50 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ for $c \mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{OL}$ and -OH groups. The introduction of $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{x}}$ revealed divergent effects: increasing $W_{\text {ad }}$ for crystalline $\mathrm{CeO}_{2} / \mathrm{SiO}_{2}\left(0.58 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^{2}\right)$ while decreasing it for $a \mathrm{CeO}_{2} / \mathrm{SiO}_{2}\left(0.60 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^{2}\right)$. Notably, $a \mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ showed the highest $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ affinity with a $W_{\text {ad }}$ of $2.40 \mathrm{~J} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$. Our results demonstrated that less $c \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, rich in -OH and - $\mathrm{NO}_{3}$ groups, showed higher adhesion energies, suggesting their greater efficacy in CMP processes. This study highlights the importance of the surface chemistry of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles and crystallinity in semiconductor fabrication, offering insights for developing next-generation abrasives for CMP applications.
