#### Abstract

In this paper, we have studied the CMP characteristics of mixed abrasive slurry (MAS) retreated by adding of ceria abrasives within 1:10 diluted silica slurry (DSS). We focused on how these mixed ceria abrasives affect the material removal in order to determine the optimal recipe conditions through the correlation between the mixed contents of ceria abrasives and CMP performances. The slurry designed for optimal performance should produce reasonable removal rates, acceptable polishing selectivity with respect to the underlying layer, low surface defects after polishing, and good slurry stability. The modified abrasives in MAS are evaluated with respect to their particle size distribution, surface morphology, and CMP performances such as removal rate and non-uniformity. As a result, the oxide CMP process using diluted mixed abrasive slurry has problems of higher material removal rate at wafer center. But, we solved the questions in consecutive order by pH control. We obtained the comparable slurry characteristics to original silica slurry in the viewpoint of high removal rate and low non-uniformity. Finally, our proposed ceria-MAS can be useful to save a slurry consumption of high cost since we used 1:10 diluted mixed abrasive slurry.

## 1. Introduction

Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) has become one of the most important technologies for producing nano-scale semiconductor devices because it meets the stringent requirements for ever increasing integrated intensities and yields. CMP process has been widely used to obtain the global planarization of inter-metal dielectric (IMD) layers, inter-layer dielectric layers (ILD) and pre-metal dielectric (PMD) layers. ${ }^{1-5}$ In general, chemical compositions and abrasives of the slurry play a very important role in the removal rate and within-wafer non-uniformity for global planarization ability of CMP process. The conventional slurry consists of abrasive particles of the solid state suspended in a liquid state-chemical solution. The abrasive in the slurry transfers mechanical energy to the surface being polished and plays a key role in its material removal. In the manufacturing process for ULSI chip, the abrasive of widely used slurry is silica $\left(\mathrm{SiO}_{2}\right)$ and alumina $\left(\mathrm{Al} 2 \mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$. Ceria $\left(\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\right)$ has been more commonly used for glass polishing, and recently for oxide films for shallow trench isolation (STI) structure. Through chemical reaction and mechanical action, the abrasiveliquid interaction plays an important role in determining the optimum abrasives type and size, their shape and concentration. ${ }^{6,7}$ The slurry was
designed for optimal performance which produced reasonable removal rates, acceptable polishing selectivity with respect to underlying layer, low surface defects after polishing, and good slurry stability. ${ }^{8}$ One of the most critical problems is the higher cost of consumables (COC) such as pad, slurry, backing film, and pad conditioner which accounts for over $70 \%$ of cost of ownership (COO). Since a sufficient amount of slurry is required to get a higher removal rate (RR) and lower within-wafer non-uniformity (WIWNU), there have recently been many studies on the reduction of slurry consumption since the cost of the slurry is about $40 \%$ of COC. Total slurry revenues will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of $8.2 \%$ between years 2008 and 2014. This must be factored into the changing landscape between low-cost ILD slurry, which is in decline compared to high-priced metal and ceria-based shallow trench isolation (STI) slurry. Revenues generated will grow from $\$ 874$ million in the year 2008 to $\$ 1,402$ million in 2014. The volume of slurry will grow at a CAGR of $16.8 \%$ from 1.4 million 55 gallon drums in 2008 to 3.6 million in $2014 .{ }^{9}$

In this paper, we have studied the CMP characteristics of mixed abrasive slurry (MAS) retreated by adding of Ceria $\left(\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\right)$ abrasives within 1:10 diluted silica slurry (DSS). We focused on how these mixed ceria abrasives affect the material removal in order to determine the

optimal recipe conditions through the correlation between the mixed contents of ceria abrasives and CMP performances in our self-developed. In this work, slurries containing $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives and $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ particles dispersed in DIW at pH 5-11 were studied for the oxide CMP process. The modified abrasives in the MAS were evaluated with respect to their CMP performances such as removal rate and non-uniformity and peak to valley roughness. Our main goal is to examine how these mixed two particles affect the CMP characteristics of oxide layer.

## 2. Theory

### 2.1 Single Abrasive Slurry (SAS)

When the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ particles are dispersed in an aqueous alkaline solution, the $\mathrm{OH}^{\prime}$ ions are selectively adsorbed on the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ particle surface, and the $\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}$ bonds are dissociated as shown in Eq. 1. ${ }^{1,10-12}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \equiv \mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si} \equiv+\mathrm{OH}^{\prime} \\
& \rightarrow \equiv \mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}
\end{aligned}
$$

Eventually, the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ particle surface is negatively charged. The positive ions, which are diffused in the slurry liquid, surround the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ particles to neutralize the negative surface charges. Verwey and Overbeek calculated the potential energy (V) between the particles as the sum of the repulsive $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{R}}\right)$ and the attractive potentials $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{A}}\right)$ as shown in Eq. 2. ${ }^{11,13}$

$$
\mathrm{V}=\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{R}}+\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{A}}
$$

If the repulsive potential energy decreases down to the attractive potential energy, such as $\left|V_{\mathrm{R}}\right|<\left|V_{\mathrm{A}}\right|$, the particles tend to agglomerate. When the large particles, which originate from the agglomeration of slurry, come in contact with the wafer surface during polishing, microscratches cause a circuit failure and affect the yield of devices. ${ }^{14,15}$

### 2.2 Mixed Abrasive Slurry (MAS)

The polishing mechanism by both abrasives in MAS, consists of two types of abrasive particles, has been reported by S. V. Babu and his laboratory members. ${ }^{16,17}$ When two types of particles are dispersed
![img-0.jpeg](images\img-0.jpeg)

Fig. 1 Schematic of the proposed polishing mechanism by abrasive in mixed abrasive slurry
together, additional particle-particle interactions occur. And they can influence the interaction between the particle and film during CMP, which can be adjusted to optimize the slurry performance in terms of removal rate and surface defect. ${ }^{18-22}$ One of examples is to disperse mechanically larger $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles in the slurry containing relatively smaller $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ particles. This dispersion has enough abrasion capability for material removal without surface defect. That is to say, there is improved CMP performance of MAS due to the interplay between the abrasive action of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles and chemical-tooth nature of the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ particles surrounding the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles. Fig. 1 show the schematic diagrams of agglomeration and dispersion effects of MAS.

## 3. Experiments

The CMP setup and procedure have been described elsewhere. ${ }^{1,14,18-}$ ${ }^{20}$ In brief, in order to prepare the MAS, colloidal silica slurry of pH 11 was diluted in DIW with 1:10 ratio. Nitric acid and KOH was added as a buffering agent to keep pH 5 and pH 11 level controlled. The $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives particles were then added in the diluted silica slurry. We have prepared the four kinds of slurry in order to compare the effect of agglomeration and dispersion on polishing efficiency. The concentration of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive was varied from $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$ to $9 \mathrm{wt} \%$. The particle size distribution of the slurries was measured by using a Zeta potentiometer from Otsuka electronics Co. An oxide layer of $20,000 \AA$ was deposited on 4 -inch blanket wafer. The CMP polishing of all test wafers was performed with a G\&P POLI-500 CMP polisher. The polishing pad was an IC-1400 from Dow electronic materials. A diamond pad conditioner was utilized to abrade the pad before conducting each polishing test. The parameter range of the optimized CMP process was summarized in our previously published papers. ${ }^{21,25}$ Table 1 shows the process conditions as functions of ceria abrasive addition. A ST-5030SL system of the K-MAC company was used to measure the oxide thickness. The surface roughness of the polished wafers was obtained using atomic force microscopy (AFM; PSIA, XE-100) technique.

## 4. Results and Discussion

Slurry using $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles does not have dispersibility than the existing silica slurry, but has many merits such as high selection ratio, so commonly used in CMP process. However, ceria CMP has high

wafer center removal rate (RR) and shows different behaviors comparison to silica particles (e.g. causing a loading time). This is an outcome that is not seen when silica particles are used, which becomes the main cause that worsens uniformity after the CMP. As a result, ceria slurry has a polishing mechanism through the reaction of condensation between the silanol group and the ceria particle surface. It has a reaction formula in the form of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{OH}+\cdot \mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{OH} \mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Si}-\mathrm{+H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, and when $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles are used, it has a CMP mechanism of oxide chemical tooth. This is because a strong chemical interaction affects between ceria and silica, and chemical aspects are more important as compared to silica particles.

Fig. 2 shows the comparison of removal rate and profile as a function of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive addition amount of $\mathrm{pH} 12-12.5$. It is well known as the center fast aspect of material removal rate. Therefore, the slurry accumulation in the wafer center can be predicted during CMP. Also, another reason is that the specific gravity of dispersed $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives is higher than that of silica abrasives. As shown in the result, the average polishing rate showed the amount of removal of $1360 \AA / \mathrm{min}$ when the slurry was diluted, but when $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \% \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles were added after dilution, the amount of polishing tended to decrease. However, the more the amount of addition of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, the more the polishing rate became, according to the amount of addition, but the polishing rate in the center of the wafer showed higher polishing rate

than the edge of it did. Fig. 3 shows uniformity according to the amount of addition of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, and the more the amount of addition, the less the uniformity tended to become. This seems that, as described above, a strong chemical interaction affects between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and silica. The dispersed liquid of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles basically has neutrality.

Figs. 4 and 5 show the comparison of removal rate and nonuniformity as a function of pH control in the ceria abrasive addition of $9 \mathrm{wt} \%$, respectively. Fig. 4 shows RR and non-uniformity ( $\mathrm{NU} \%$ ) when oxide CMP was conducted, changing the pH by adding KOH and $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$. Oxide RR has pH 8 , and in acid area, one with lower pH , RR tended to decrease. For silica particles, as pH increases to base, RR increases, but $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ particles have the maximum RR in the weak base area. RR gets lower in acid because pH is in acid area, the degree of dissociation of the silanol group gets lower, so it is difficult to have a polishing mechanism of chemical reaction of condensation with the ceria particle surface. ${ }^{6}$ Fig. 5 shows $\mathrm{NU} \%$ data by pH . As it changes from alkali area to acid area, it shows much better result in terms of non-uniformity. Generally, the typical non-uniformity of the insulating film, metal film, and metal oxide film have to be below $5.0 \%$ in order to obtain stable characteristics of a CMP process.

Three-dimensional surface morphology of the polished oxide layer are shown in Fig. 6, where the layer was polished by $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ adding

that the more smoothened surface can be prepared by polishing with pH 6 content. Because deep scratches were not induced by this polishing, this polishing is useful for the oxide CMP process. Also, the polishing profile as a function of pH control for the case of ceria addition amount of $9 \mathrm{wt} \%$ showed more stable state in comparison of other samples. The roughness of surface was determined quantitatively by the AFM measurement. The surface roughness was defined by peak to valley roughness (Rpv) value. Fig. 7 compares the Rpv values of surface polished by $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-MAS with a different abrasive content. For the case of $\mathrm{pH} 5 \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-adding, the high Rpv value of 7.8 nm was obtained.

## 5. Conclusions

This study was performed, aiming at a method for reducing the cost of consumables (COC) based on the background theory of CMP processing and producing equal cost of performance (COP) for undiluted solution slurry. As for the elements affecting CMP characteristics, in addition to an impact by consumables, there is an impact by CMP equipment, but this study looked into the impacts of the elements on CMP characteristics when the slurry was diluted, which accounted for over $40 \%$ of the consumable goods of the constituent. In terms of polishing rate and heterogeneity of oxide film, it was found that it shows more excellent characteristics than those of ceria undiluted solution slurry. Thus, it can save the slurry that bears the most cost during CMP process, so it is expected that it can reduce the cost of processing and manufacturing to improve productivity, and for the precision polishing process with minute pattern, first carrying out polishing process using the mixed polishing slurry proposed in this study and then polishing using undiluted solution slurry may make the process of processing somewhat complicated, but relatively expensive slurry consumption may be reduced. Finally, it is expected that applying this to CMP processing of metals such as $\mathrm{Cu}, \mathrm{Al}$ and W or printed circuit board (PCB) CMP processing using noble metal or massive slurry, in which it takes much time to process polishing will bring about an effect on saving the processing cost to a half or more and improve productivity.
