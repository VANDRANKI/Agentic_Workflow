In recent years, Ultra-Thin Glass (UTG) has attracted substantial market attention due to its multi-scenario applications. One of the technical cores in UTG manufacturing is the abrasive design of the chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process. The present work proposed rare-earth-doped core-shell structured $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$, and $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}$ abrasives synthesized by a low-temperature two-step method. The core-shell abrasives are large uniform nanospheres with a size of about $375 \mathrm{~nm}-450 \mathrm{~nm}$. According to the matching effect of $\mathrm{RE}^{3+}$ radii and defect sizes, $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ with larger radii exhibits a more substantial modulation effect than $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ upon the lattice distortion and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+} / \mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ chemical shift. The CMP results revealed the superior polishing efficiency and better flattening ability of core-shell abrasives. The optimized $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$ shows the best glass polishing ability $\left(M R R=480.22 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}, R a=0.32 \mathrm{~nm}\right)$, which is attributed to the increased $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ composition from $9.79 \%$ to $28.14 \%$ (compared with the pristine $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ ) and large particle size, indicative of potential applications of novel abrasive systems in the field of glass polishing.

## 1. Introduction

With the rapid advancement of communication technology, the screen display system has been updated and iterated in the direction of ultra-thin and flexible in recent years [1]. For its high chemical stability, low product costs, and tolerance to heat treatment, Ultra-Thin Glass (UTG) has substantial market potential and scientific research values in many fields, such as flexible OLEDs [2], wearable electrochemical sensors [3], micro-fluidic chips [4], and foldable displays [5]. Even several technologies, including overflow down-draw, slit pull-down, and float processes, could fabricate glass sheets allowing the minimum thickness to be a few micrometers, the glass substrates still need to be polished to achieve efficient thinning and a precisely flat surface, which is still very challenging now.

Because of the high planarization ability and precise controllability for specific applications, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) is critical in many fabrications requiring flat and smooth surfaces, such as ultraprecision optical components [6], ultra-large-scale integrated circuit devices [7], and liquid crystal glass substrates [8]. In a typical CMP
process, material removal and flattening are achieved by the synergistic effect of abrasive mechanical friction and chemical corrosion [9]. Compared to conventional abrasives, like $\mathrm{SiO} 2$ [10-11] and $\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O} 3$ [12], $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ with oxygen vacancies and unique $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+} / \mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ redox pair contributes significantly to the chemical corrosion function on glass material removal [9], exhibiting high polishing efficiency and is considered as one of the most promising CMP abrasives.

The polishing characteristics of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based abrasives are highly dependent on the size [13], shape [14], and mixture [15] at the nanoscale. Oh et al. reported that the oxide CMP removal rate monotonously increases with the particle size of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives [13]. However, the size distribution and morphology of conventional ceria abrasives are challenging to be controlled with calcination, and scratches or other mechanical damages may occur during material removal processes. Recently, the core-shell structured composites were introduced into CMP, due to their round surface morphology, narrow size distribution, and low elastic moduli [16-18], which could effectively decrease scratch defects [19]. The PS core size [20] and $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ shell thickness [21] have been found that significantly affect the CMP performance due to

the spring-like effect. However, most of the research on CMP applies to integrated circuits, and research on the polishing ability of $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is conducted on silicon wafers, with insufficient research on its polishing performance on glass surfaces.

On the other hand, the chemical-tooth effect, the solid-state tribechemical reaction between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives and the substrate surface
[22], plays a vital role in CMP, and it has been proposed that $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, instead of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, assists in breaking Si-O bond during CMP. Thus many studies devoted to enriching the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ by decreasing particle size [23], calcination with hydrogen [24], lowering the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ content in polishing slurry [25], and introducing dopants.

In the present work, a novel abrasive system that applies the combination of chemical modification that regulates the chemical activity of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ via doping rare earth ions and structure optimization via establishing the core-shell structure was conducted, which was facilely achieved by a low-temperature wet chemistry method. Moreover, the CMP performance of the novel lanthanide doping core-shell $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive on the glass is first investigated and thoroughly compared with that of the available $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasives bought from the market. The results indicate that core-shell abrasives are large uniform nanospheres, and the doping rare earth ions ( $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ ) effectively regulate the crystalline structure and chemical shift of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+} / \mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$, which benefit the glass polish efficiency. The optimal abrasive, $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ doped $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, significantly improves the polishing material removal rate by $42.07 \%$, compared with the commercial abrasives. The relevance of rare earth ion doping, $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ microscopic phases, and glass polishing performance have been discussed in detail.

Except that St was treated with 5 wt\% of aqueous NaOH solution to remove the inhibitor before use, other chemical reagents were used without further purification.

The commercial $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ abrasive $\left(\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\right)$ was bought from Xuancheng Jingrui New Materials Co., Ltd. The $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$-based industrial polishing powder $\left(\mathrm{G}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\right)$ and the soda lime glass substrates used for CMP experiments were provided by CNBM Bengbu Design and Research Institute for Glass Industry Co., Ltd. The porous polyurethane polishing pad was bought from Shenzhen Fangda Grinding Technology Co., Ltd.

### 2.2. Preparation

Core-shell abrasives were prepared using a two-step method. The negative-charged PS (.) nanospheres were synthesized by emulsifier-free emulsion polymerization under a nitrogen atmosphere: 10 g St and 0.32 g AA were dispersed in 150 ml water in a flask with continuous stirring and heated to $70^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ gradually. After holding for $30 \mathrm{~min}, 0.41 \mathrm{~g}$ KPS (dissolved in 30 ml water) was added to initiate polymerization and maintained at $70^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 7 h , then cooled to room temperature to stop polymerization.

In a typical synthesis of core-shell abrasives, 4 ml of the prepared PS colloids were dispersed into 200 ml water and separated homogeneously with a cell grinder for 10 min as the core precursor. 50 ml of $0.02 \mathrm{~mol} \cdot \mathrm{~L}^{-1}$ $\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ aqueous solution for the pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, or of $0.019 \mathrm{~mol} \cdot \mathrm{~L}^{-1}$
$\mathrm{Ce}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and $0.88 \mathrm{mmol} \cdot \mathrm{L}^{-1} \mathrm{La}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / \mathrm{Yb}\left(\mathrm{NO}_{3}\right)_{3} \cdot 5 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ aqueous solution for the doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, was added as the shell precursor and stirred for 30 min , then 50 ml of $25 \mathrm{mmol} \cdot \mathrm{L}^{-1} \mathrm{HMT}$ aqueous solution was added to initiate the precipitation. The homogeneous suspension was heated at $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 2 h under stirring, then cooled to room temperature and aged for 1 h . The obtained sediments were separated by centrifugation and washed with ethanol, then dried at $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in the air for 2 h . The samples were labeled as $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$, and $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}$ for the pristine core-shell $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{La}$-doped core-shell $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, and Yb-doped core-shell $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, respectively. Deionized water was used throughout the synthesis process.

### 2.3. Structural characterization

The morphology and microstructure were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi). The nano-particle size analyzer (Zeta, Zetasizer Nano-ZS, Marven) measured the average particle size. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEMS-F200, JEOL) equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system was adopted to visualize the composite nanospheres' core-shell morphology, lattice information, and element distribution. Before the observation, the powder samples were dispersed in ethanol and dripped onto the carbon film. The phase information and lattice structure were measured by X-Ray diffraction (XRD, RIGAKU D/MAX $2550 / \mathrm{PC}$, Rigaku) under the operation voltage of 40 kV , current of 40 mA , and $\mathrm{Cu} \mathrm{K} \alpha(\lambda=1.54178 \AA)$ as the radiation source. Raman spectra were collected at ambient conditions using a microscopic confocal Raman spectrometer (Raman, LABRAM HR Evolution, HORIBA Jobin Yvon) with a 633 nm laser as the excitation source. The doping element contents were measured using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-OES, 7800, Agilent Technologies Inc.). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS SUPRA, Krato) was carried out with a dual $\mathrm{Mg} / \mathrm{Al}$ anode (Power $\geq 500 \mathrm{~W}$ ), and the C-C signal at 284.8 eV calibrated the measured binding energy before the peak fitting. The molar ratio of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+} / \mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ was calculated based on the deconvolution of Ce 3d spin-orbit doublet using XPSPEAK software. The thermogravimetric and differential thermal analyses were conducted under an air atmosphere from 30 to $800^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at a heating rate of $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}-\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ using a thermal analyzer (TG-DTA, DSCQ1000, TA). The surface topography, average roughness $\left(R_{a}\right)$ over scans of $5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m} \times 5.0 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ area, and profile

curve were measured by atomic force microscope (AFM, Dimension ICON, Bruker) under the contact mode.

### 2.4. Polishing test

The soda lime glasses ( $20 \mathrm{~mm} \times 20 \mathrm{~mm} \times 2 \mathrm{~mm}$ ) were used as the substrates and polished on a chemical mechanical polishing machine with a porous polyurethane pad (Alpha-600, Suzhou TROJAN Materials Technology Co.). After polishing, the substrates were rinsed sequentially with water and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath and then air-dried for the subsequent measurements. Table 1 lists the polishing parameters.

The solid content was set at $1 \mathrm{wt} \%$ for the polishing slurry preparation, and the pH value was adjusted to 7 by 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution. The polishing slurries were prepared based on $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, PS@CeO $\mathrm{O}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$, and $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}$ abrasives. The slurries based on $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{G}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ were designed as the control group. The weights of the glass substrate before and after polishing were measured by an electron
balance of exactly 0.01 mg (XS105, METTLER TOLEDO) to calculate the material removal rate (MRR) according to Eq. (1): [26]
$M R R=\frac{\Delta m}{\rho t s}$
where $\rho$ is the density of the soda lime glass, equal to $2.52 \mathrm{~g} \cdot \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$ (Glass Density Measuring Instrument, MD-100, Beijing XuHui Xinrui Technology Co., Ltd.), $s$ is the surface area, which is $4 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ here, $t$ is the polishing time, and $\Delta m$ is the weight loss by polishing. Three parallel experiments were conducted for every polishing slurry, and the arithmetic mean values were used to present the MRR results.

## 3. Results and discussions

The quantitative element test was carried out by ICP-OES, as shown in Table 2. The measured doping concentrations of La and Yb are $4.41 \%$ and $4.43 \%$, respectively, very close to the nominal value (4.4\%),

indicating that the precipitant method employed here can provide a reasonable dopant control. The morphological information of the PS core, $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$, and $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}$ was tested by SEM, as shown in Fig. 1. The PS core exhibits a uniform spherical structure with a smooth surface. The average particle size is about 332 nm (Fig. 1a). Conversely, as illustrated in Fig. $1 \mathrm{~b}-1 \mathrm{~d}$, the outer surfaces of the three core-shell abrasives are composed of small nanocrystals, significantly rougher than that of the PS cores. The average particle sizes are about $377 \mathrm{~nm}, 381 \mathrm{~nm}$, and 392 nm for $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$, and $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}$, respectively (see Fig. S1). The particle sizes were also measured using the dynamic light scattering method which confirmed the SEM statistical results, as listed in Table 2. Therefore, the calculated thickness of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ shell is about $25 \mathrm{~nm} \sim 60 \mathrm{~nm}$. Note that all cor-e-shell particles exhibit a larger size than the reported abrasives [27-31], possibly leading to a higher material removal efficiency [13,32].

The XRD profiles of $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$, and $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}$ are
![img-5.jpeg](images\img-5.jpeg)
shown in Fig. 2a. The diffraction peaks at about $28.5^{\circ}, 33.0^{\circ}, 47.4^{\circ}$, and $56.4^{\circ}$ are respectively attributed to (111), (200), (220), and (311) crystal planes of fluorite $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (JCDPS NO. 43-1002) and no extra diffraction peaks related to $\mathrm{La}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ or $\mathrm{Yb}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ are found in the doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, suggesting that the doping of $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ or $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ does not occasion the formation of the second phase. As shown in the magnified view of Fig. 2a, the diffraction peaks of the doped samples show a noticeable shift compared with the pristine $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, preliminary suggesting that $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ are doped in the lattice. Moreover, for $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ doping, the diffraction peaks shift significantly to the large angle direction ((111) plane, $\left.28.50^{\circ} \rightarrow 28.52^{\circ}\right)$, while for $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ doping, the diffraction peaks shift to the small angle direction ((111) plane, $28.50^{\circ} \rightarrow 28.35^{\circ}$ ). Such tendency could be ascribed to the different ionic radii of $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}(0.97 \AA$ ) [33] and $\mathrm{La}^{3+}(1.16 \AA)$ [33-34], which are respectively smaller or larger than that of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}(0.97 \AA)$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}(1.07 \AA)$ [35], resulting in the lattice shrinkage or expansion. The lattice parameters based on the XRD peaks are tabulated in Table 3, which are $5.4267 \AA, 5.4448 \AA$, and $5.4106 \AA$ for

$\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$, and $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}$, respectively, further revealing the lattice distortion by the dopants. The grain sizes (D) were calculated by the Debye-Scherrer equation according to the (111) plane, as shown in Table 3, which are $9.0 \mathrm{~nm}, 8.2 \mathrm{~nm}$, and 6.7 nm for $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$, and $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}$, respectively, indicating that the $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ dopings inhibit the crystalline of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. It is worth noting that the lattice distortion is not only affected by the radius mismatch between the $\mathrm{La}^{3+} / \mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ and Ce ions but also related to the increased oxygen vacancies and $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration [34], which will be discussed later.

The Raman spectra are more indicative of the single-phase composition of the doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ shells. As shown in Fig. 2b, only one peak is found near $460 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ in the range of $200 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}-1000 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, assigned to the $\mathrm{F}_{2 g}$ symmetric vibration mode of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}-\mathrm{Ce}$. No other peaks corresponding to $\mathrm{La}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ or $\mathrm{Yb}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ (36) are found in the spectra. Additionally, a decrease in the wave number of the $\mathrm{F}_{2 g}$ peak can be observed in the order of $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}\left(460.636 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\right)>\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}\left(459.902 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\right)>$ $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}\left(456.656 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}\right)$. Such peak position shift is consistent with the lattice distortion raised by doping, confirming the preliminary conclusion suggested by XRD. For $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, the lattice shrinkage results in a stronger bonding of $\mathrm{Ce}-\mathrm{O}$, causing a blue shift with a value of $3.256 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. In contrast, the doping of $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ expands the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice, leading to a red shift with a value of $0.734 \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. Combining the analysis of Raman spectra and XRD diffraction, it can be concluded that the two-step method in this work successfully prepared the core-shell nanospheres with tiny doping of $\mathrm{La}^{3+} / \mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ and that the dope caused microscopic lattice changes in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ shell.

Based on the TEM images (Fig. 3), one can see an apparent contrast between the thin dark edge and large lighter center of all abrasives synthesized in this work, exhibiting well-defined core-shell structures. The average particle size information calculated from the TEM is 382.4 nm, 388.7 nm , and 389.1 nm for $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$, and $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ : Yb, respectively, consistent with SEM and light scattering data. According to the HRTEM image of $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, the plane spacing of the shell particles was measured to be $0.313 \mathrm{~nm}, 0.192 \mathrm{~nm}$, and 0.163 nm , corresponding to the (111), (220), and (311) plane spacing of pure $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, respectively [37-38]. Meanwhile, the doped core-shell $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ exhibits an increased/decreased plane spacing according to doping $\mathrm{La}^{3+} / \mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$, which is in harmony with the conclusion of XRD and Raman spectra.

The EDS mapping images of $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$ and $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}$ are shown in Fig. 4, which directly demonstrate the organic core and $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ shell structured nanospheres, simultaneously showing a homogeneous
distribution of the doped $\mathrm{La}^{3+} / \mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$, confirming no second phase generation, which is consistent with the above characterization analysis.

The high-resolution XPS spectra of Ce 3d are shown in Fig. 5a. The complex Ce 3 d region can be fitted according to Romeo et al. [39] with ten components that take into account the spin-orbit split $\mathrm{Ce} 3 \mathrm{~d}_{5 / 2}, \mathrm{Ce}$ $3 \mathrm{~d}_{3 / 2}$, and other splitting caused by a redistribution of the entire energy spectrum after a core hole is created [37]. The content of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ can be calculated based on the area fraction of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ in the total area $\left(\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}\right.$ and $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ ), as shown in Table 3. As expected, the $\mathrm{RE}^{3+}$ doping increases the content of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$. $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$ exhibits the highest concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ (28.14\%), which is two times greater than that of $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (9.79\%), while the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ enrichment of the $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ doping is relatively low $(15.42 \%)$.

The XPS spectra in the $\mathrm{O} 1 s$ region can be deconvoluted into three peaks, as shown in Fig. 5b, centered at about $527.8 \mathrm{eV}, 531.3 \mathrm{eV}$, and 532.3 eV , which could be assigned to the $\mathrm{O}^{2-}$ ions in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice (denoted as $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{a}}$ ), the bound oxygen related to the presence of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}}$ in a matrix of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (denoted as $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{p}}$ ), and the absorbed oxygen (denoted as $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{v}}$ ), respectively [40]. Based on the peak area ratio, the calculated content of $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{p}}$ species show a decrease order of $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}\left(\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{p}} \%=}\right.$ $18.2 \%)>\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{p}} \%=16.59 \%)>\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{p}} \%=8.97 \%\right)$, consistent with the tendency of the $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ content, suggesting that $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ exhibit stronger tunability of the chemical shift in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ than $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$. Since the lattice expansion caused by $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ could compensate for the lattice shrinkage caused by oxygen vacancies, the system is easier to achieve stress equilibrium with $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ doping, which is more inducible for forming oxygen defects, facilitating the reduction of $\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}$ to $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ because of the charge balance. Thus, $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$ perform better enhancement on $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ components in $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice than $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}$.

In addition, the XPS analysis of $\mathrm{La}^{3+} / \mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ in $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$ and $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}$ demonstrates the $\mathrm{La}^{3+}-\mathrm{O} / \mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$-O formation [41-42] (see Fig. S2), which is consistent with the inferences drawn from XRD and Raman analysis.

The TG and DTA tests were carried out to quantitively analyze the solid content of the core-shell abrasives, as shown in Fig. 6. Three weight loss stages could be found for all three samples. In the first stage, before $250^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, a slight weight loss can be attributed to water's evaporation. In the second stage, up to about $410^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the sharp weight loss could be ascribed to the consecutive decomposition of the PS cores. The weight losses are about $39.51 \%, 38.70 \%$, and $34.52 \%$ for $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$, and $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}$, respectively. Then in the third stage, up to about $700{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the weight losses are about $12.62 \%, 19.06 \%$, and $15.12 \%$ for $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$, and $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}$, respectively. These sharper losses could be attributed to the oxidation of the residual polymers [38]. Since the residual weight comes from the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ shell, the weight ratios of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ in three core-shell abrasives calculated from TGA are about $47.86 \%, 46.18 \%$, and $46.42 \%$ for $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}, \mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$, and $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}$, respectively, simultaneously indicate that they have a similar core-shell structure, further proves the analysis conclusions of SEM and TEM. Therefore, the actual weight of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ used in the homemade polishing slurries will be $50 \%$ less than that of the commercially available slurries, matching the sustainability request in future CMP [43].

Before the CMP test, the surface morphology of the glass substrates was characterized by AFM, showing a relatively rough feature with irregular spherical projections, and the $R_{\mathrm{a}}$ value was 3.08 nm (see Fig. S3). The surface characteristics of the glass substrates after CMP with the synthesized core-shell abrasives were analyzed by AFM in three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) modes, as shown in Fig. 7. A few slight scratches were observed on the $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ polished glass substrate (Fig. 7a). In contrast, no scratch but some small protrusions on the $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$ and $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}$ polished glass substrates are found (Fig. 7b and 7c). The line profiles along the diagonal in the 2D AFM images were also selected to facilitate the subsequent comparison and analysis. The corresponding results reveal the Max valley depth ( $R v$ ) of about $1.95 \mathrm{~nm}, 0.79 \mathrm{~nm}$, and 1.57 nm for glasses polished by

The average MRR, $R a$, and $R v$ values were summarized in Table 4 and Fig. 8 to evaluate the polishing performance quantitively.

All core-shell abrasives synthesized here performed a higher material removal rate than the control group $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ by about $27.09 \%$ $42.07 \%$ (see Fig. S4a) and G-CeO2 by about $9.03 \%-21.88 \%$ (see Fig. S4b), confirming the superiority of core-shell structure, as discussed in the introduction section. Such improvement could be mainly attributed to their large particle size and the increased active $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ caused by the PS core [13,32]. Meanwhile, core-shell abrasives exhibit excellent

planar ability with $R a$ less than $0.5 \mathrm{~nm} \sim$, while for $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{G}-\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, the $R a$ values are 1.33 and 0.57 , respectively. Such a phenomenon could be attributed to the lower elastic moduli induced by the PS core, according to the previous research conducted by Chen et al [16,19].

Among the core-shell abrasives, $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$ shows the highest polishing efficiency, which improves by $9.2 \%$ in MRR and reduces by $75.94 \%$ in $R a$ compared with $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. According to previous reports [24,44], the material removal ability of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ on glass is positively correlated to internal $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ fraction, which will facilitate the frictional chemical activity between $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}-\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$, thereby improving the material removal efficiency. As discussed in the XPS results, $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$ has the highest $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ concentration, leading to the best removal efficiency, supposing that $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ plays a vital role in tearing down the $\mathrm{SiO}_{2}$ hydrated layer. Meanwhile, the decreased crystallinity of $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$ and $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{Yb}$ can reduce surface scratches to the glass, contributing to the preciseness of the polished glass, which is consistent with the $R a$ values calculated by AFM.

In summary, low-concentration doping of rare earth ions $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$ and $\mathrm{Yb}^{3+}$ effectively regulates $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ components within $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$. It reduces the crystallinity of the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ shell, which significantly improves the polishing efficiency and increases the precision of the glass surface during CMP. The characterization and performance analysis of three core-shell samples confirmed the advantage of core-shell structures and further optimization of the core-shell abrasive system by doping modification, which compensates for the deficiency of research on $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ in the field of glass polishing and provides a brief reference for the selection of polishing parameters selection for glass CMP research.

## 4. Conclusion

The present work proposes a novel abrasive design scheme suitable for glass surface flattening, using a facile, low-temperature, controllable two-step method to prepare core-shell structured rare earth ion doping $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$, around 400 nm . TEM and EDS tests demonstrate the $\mathrm{RE}^{3+}$ doped $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ outer shell and the inner PS core. The core-shell abrasives synthesized here exhibit an enhanced polishing efficiency of $27.09 \%$ $42.07 \%$ and significantly better planarization ability than commercial $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ due to the larger particle radius and spring-like effect introduced by the PS core. Among the core-shell abrasives, $\mathrm{PS} @ \mathrm{CeO}_{2}: \mathrm{La}$ shows the highest material removal efficiency ( $M R R=480.22 \mathrm{~nm} / \mathrm{min}$ ) and the flattest polished surface ( $R a=0.32 \mathrm{~nm}$ ), which could be attributed to the highest concentration of $\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}$ resulting from the larger ionic radii of $\mathrm{La}^{3+}$. The results of the current work provide a strategy to optimize the abrasives and indicate that La-doped core-shell $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ is an excellent abrasive for high-performance CMP.
