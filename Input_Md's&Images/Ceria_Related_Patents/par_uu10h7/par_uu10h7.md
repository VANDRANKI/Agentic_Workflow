## 1 <br> CHEMICAL MECHANICAL POLISHING SLURRY COMPOSITION FOR POLISHING POLYCRYSTALLINE SILICON FILM

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2017-0161624, filed on Nov. 29, 2017, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

## TECHNICAL FIELD

The following disclosure relates to a chemical mechanical 15 polishing slurry composition for polishing a polycrystalline silicon film.

## BACKGROUND

In the semiconductor process, chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) is used as a surface polishing process for forming highly integrated multilayer structured devices. As the pattern size of semiconductors gradually decreases, the importance of the polishing process in the manufacture of patterns is gradually increasing. In a process for manufacturing a semiconductor device, single crystal silicon wafers, which are capable of making initial material at a low cost and making an oxide film with excellent electrical insulation properties, are used as a main material. In the semiconductor process, surface roughness of the silicon wafer has a great influence on subsequent processes, and thus performance of planarization using the CMP process is essential. Polycrystalline silicon thin film is used in processes for manufacturing integrated chips (ICs), recess channel array transistors (RCATs), and 3D Fin Field-effect transistors (FinFET), and thus there is a need for research on minimization of the surface roughness using the CMP process.

Polishing compositions may be used for polishing silicon materials, i.e., silicon groups such as silicon single crystal, amorphous silicon, polysilicon, and the like, and silicon compounds such as silicon nitride, and silicon oxide. More specifically, for example, polishing compositions are mainly used for polishing silicon substrates such as single crystal silicon substrates, or the like; or for polishing silicon group films such as amorphous silicon films, polycrystalline silicon films, or the like, or silicon compounds such as silicon nitride, silicon oxide, or the like, formed on the silicon substrate. Silicon compound films include low-k films with a relative permittivity of 3 or less. In low-k films, the polishing selectivity and polishing speed are key points for the semiconductor polishing process. Thus, there is a need for studies on a polishing slurry composition with a high polishing speed and various polishing selectivities.

Therefore, the present inventors studied compositions for polishing a polycrystalline silicon film, found that when a compound including a thio group or a thiol group was used and added as an additive in a polycrystalline silicon polishing composition including a polishing agent it was possible to prepare a polishing slurry composition with an improved polishing speed and various polishing selectivities, and thus completed the present invention.

![img-7.jpeg](images\img-7.jpeg)
${ }^{35} \mathrm{R}_{6}$ may be a linear or branched $\mathrm{C}_{1}-\mathrm{C}_{3}$ alkylene, $\mathrm{R}_{7}$ may be hydrogen or a linear or branched $\mathrm{C}_{10}-\mathrm{C}_{14}$ alkyl, and n may be 0 or 1 .

Further, and most preferably, the compound represented by Chemical Formula 1 may be thiourea, thioucetamide, 2-amino-5-mercapto-1,3-thiadiazole, 2-mercaptothiazoline, mercaptobenzothiazole or 2-mercaptobenzimidazole, and the compound represented by Chemical Formula 2 may be thioglycolic acid, thiosuccinic acid, 3,3'-thiodipropionic acid, or didodecyl 3,3'-thiodipropionate.

Chemical structures of the compounds represented by Chemical Formulas 1 and 2 are summarized in Table 1 below.

TABLE 1
![img-8.jpeg](images\img-8.jpeg)

TABLE 1-continued
![img-9.jpeg](images\img-9.jpeg)

The compounds summarized in Table 1 above are shown as preferred examples of the compounds represented by Chemical Formulas 1 and 2, and the compounds represented by Chemical Formulas 1 and 2 according to an aspect of the present invention are not limited to those shown in Table 1.

In addition, in the chemical mechanical polishing slurry composition for polishing a polycrystalline silicon film, the additive includes not only the compounds represented by Chemical Formulas 1 and 2 as described above, but also compounds in the forms of thiones and thiols from the thione-thiol tautomerism thereof. For example, as a compound capable of being employed as the additive, thiourea includes both the compound in the form of a thione, represented by Chemical Formula a below, and the compound in the form of a thiol, represented by Chemical Formula b below:
![img-10.jpeg](images\img-10.jpeg)

Here, the content of the additive may be 0.03 to $0.6 \mathrm{wt} \%$, 0.02 to $0.55 \mathrm{wt} \%$, and preferably 0.01 to $0.5 \mathrm{wt} \%$, based on the total weight of the polishing slurry composition. If the content of the additive is less than $0.01 \mathrm{wt} \%$, the amount of
the additive compound to be added may be too low for the effects of promoting the polishing speed, improving the polishing selectivity of the polycrystalline silicon film due to the additive compound, and the like, to be exhibited. If the content of the additive exceeds $0.5 \mathrm{wt} \%$, the content of the additive may be excessively high, and thus the polishing properties originally sought after may be deteriorated.

The chemical mechanical polishing slurry composition for polishing a polycrystalline silicon film may include a compound represented by Chemical Formula 1 below, a compound represented by Chemical Formula 2 below, or a tautomer thereof as an additive of the polishing composition, as described above, to improve the polishing speed of the polishing process and to achieve various polishing selectivities with respect to the polycrystalline silicon film, thereby enabling achievement of an efficient polishing process for a silicon wafer (see Experimental Examples 1 and 2). Therefore, the chemical mechanical polishing slurry composition for polishing a polycrystalline silicon film may be effectively used as a composition for the surface polishing process used in the formation of highly integrated multilayer structured devices.

Further, in the chemical mechanical polishing slurry composition for polishing a polycrystalline silicon film, the pH of the polishing slurry composition may be 1.8 to 5.2 or 1.9 to 5.1 , and more preferably 2 to 5 . When the pH of the polishing slurry composition exceeds 5 , the excessive highness of the pH induces a decrease in the zeta potential to achieve electrical neutrality of the surface charge, and thus the stability and performance of the slurry may be deteriorated.

Here, the pH adjuster used to control the pH of the chemical mechanical polishing slurry composition for polishing a polycrystalline silicon film may be an inorganic acid-based pH adjuster, a carboxylic acid-based pH adjuster, an amine base-based pH adjuster, an alkali hydroxide-based pH adjuster, an ammonium hydroxide-based pH adjuster (such as a tetraalkylammonium hydroxide), and the like. More specifically, the pH adjuster may include an acidic adjuster or a basic adjuster. Preferably, the acidic adjuster may be selected from hydrochloric acid $(\mathrm{HCl})$, nitric acid $\left(\mathrm{HNO}_{3}\right)$, sulfuric acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}\right)$, phosphoric acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)$, carboxylic acid $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}\right)$, and a combination thereof, and the basic modifier may be selected from potassium hydroxide $(\mathrm{KOH})$, sodium hydroxide $(\mathrm{NaOH})$, ammonium hydroxide $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}\right)$, tetramethylamine hydroxide $(\mathrm{TMAH})$, tetramethylamine (TMA), and a combination thereof. More preferably, the acidic adjuster of nitric acid $\left(\mathrm{HNO}_{3}\right)$, phosphoric acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)$ or carboxylic acid $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}\right)$ and the basic adjuster of potassium hydroxide $(\mathrm{KOH})$ or sodium hydroxide $(\mathrm{NaOH})$ may be employed.

In addition, in the chemical mechanical polishing slurry composition for polishing a polycrystalline silicon film, the polishing agent employed may be colloidal silica, fumed silica, ceria, alumina, or the like, and more preferably colloidal silica. As the polishing agent, in addition to the above-listed polishing agents, polishing agents generally used in a polishing composition for a polycrystalline silicon film may be used within a range in which the effects of the present invention are not impaired.

Here, the colloidal silica may have a particle size of 40 nm to 120 nm , and may preferably have a spherical shape. When the particle size of the polishing agent is lower than 30 nm , the polishing efficiency of the polycrystalline silicon film may be deteriorated. When the particle size of the polishing agent exceeds 100 nm , excessive scratching may occur on a wafer surface at the time of a polishing process.

The content of the polishing agent may be 0.08 to 5.2 wt $\%, 0.09$ to $5.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$, and more preferably 0.1 to $5.0 \mathrm{wt} \%$, based on the total weight of the polishing slurry composition. When the content of the polishing agent is $0.1 \mathrm{wt} \%$ or less, the content of the polishing agent included in the slurry composition may be too low to achieve proper polishing performance on the surface of the polycrystalline silicon. When the content of the polishing agent is $5.0 \mathrm{wt} \%$ or higher, the content of the polishing agent may be excessively high, and thus the stability of the slurry may be lowered, and it may be difficult to control the polishing amount.

In addition, in the chemical mechanical polishing slurry composition for polishing a polycrystalline silicon film, the solvent may be distilled water.

Hereinafter, Examples of the present invention will be described in detail so that those skilled in the art may easily practice the present invention. However, the present invention may be implemented in various different forms and is not limited to the Examples provided herein.
