## 1 <br> SLURRY COMPOSITION FOR CHEMICAL MECHANICAL POLISHING, METHOD OF PREPARING THE SAME, AND METHOD OF FABRICATING SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICE BY USING THE SAME

CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION

This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-20180103030, filed on Aug. 30, 2018, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.

FIG. 1 is a conceptual perspective view of a polishing apparatus capable of performing chemical mechanical polishing, according to certain exemplary embodiments;

FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating a method of preparing a 50 slurry composition for chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), according to an exemplary embodiment;

FIGS. 3A to 3F are conceptual diagrams schematically illustrating the method of preparing a slurry composition for CMP, according to certain exemplary embodiments;

FIG. 4 is a plan view of a semiconductor device provided on a semiconductor substrate, according to certain exemplary embodiments; and

FIGS. 5A to 5F are cross-sectional views illustrating sequential processes of a method of fabricating a semiconductor device, according to an exemplary embodiment.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS

FIG. 1 is a conceptual perspective view of a polishing apparatus 100 capable of performing chemical mechanical polishing.

## 3

Referring to FIG. 1, the polishing apparatus 100 may include a platen $\mathbf{1 2 0}$ having a rotatable disc shape on which a polishing pad 110 is placed. The platen $\mathbf{1 2 0}$ may be rotated about a central axis $\mathbf{1 2 5}$ thereof. For example, a motor $\mathbf{1 2 1}$ may turn a driving shaft $\mathbf{1 2 4}$ to rotate the platen $\mathbf{1 2 0}$. The polishing pad 110 may be a polishing pad having at least two layers including an outer polishing layer 112 and a backing layer $\mathbf{1 1 4}$ that is more flexible than the outer polishing layer 112.

The polishing apparatus $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ may include a slurry port $\mathbf{1 3 0}$ configured to dispense a polishing agent 132, such as a slurry, toward the polishing pad 110. The polishing apparatus 100 may also include a polishing pad conditioner $\mathbf{1 6 0}$ configured to grind the polishing pad 110 such that the polishing pad 110 may be maintained in a consistent polishing state. The polishing pad conditioner $\mathbf{1 6 0}$ may rotate around a central axis thereof.

The polishing apparatus $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ may include at least one carrier head $\mathbf{1 4 0}$. The carrier head $\mathbf{1 4 0}$ may be configured to hold a substrate $\mathbf{1 0}$ against the polishing pad $\mathbf{1 1 0}$. The carrier head $\mathbf{1 4 0}$ may independently control polishing parameters, for example, pressures, associated with each substrate.

In particular, the carrier head $\mathbf{1 4 0}$ may include a retaining ring $\mathbf{1 4 2}$ to hold the substrate $\mathbf{1 0}$ under a flexible membrane, which is provided at the lower region of the carrier head $\mathbf{1 4 0}$. For example, the retaining ring $\mathbf{1 4 2}$ may surround the substrate $\mathbf{1 0}$, causing the substrate $\mathbf{1 0}$ to be retained against the flexible membrane. The carrier head $\mathbf{1 4 0}$ may include a plurality of pressurizable chambers, which may be defined by the flexible membrane and independently controlled. The plurality of pressurizable chambers may apply independently controllable pressures to associated zones of the flexible membrane and thus to associated zones of the substrate 10 .

Since the carrier head $\mathbf{1 4 0}$ may hang from a support structure 150 (e.g., a carousel or a track) and be connected to a carrier head rotating motor $\mathbf{1 5 4}$ via a driving shaft $\mathbf{1 5 2}$, the carrier head $\mathbf{1 4 0}$ may be rotated about a central axis $\mathbf{1 5 5}$ thereof. Optionally, the carrier head $\mathbf{1 4 0}$ may be vibrated in a lateral direction, for example, on a slider on the support structure $\mathbf{1 5 0}$ or the track, or may be vibrated due to rotary vibration of the support structure $\mathbf{1 5 0}$. During operation, the platen $\mathbf{1 2 0}$ may be rotated about the central axis $\mathbf{1 2 5}$ thereof, and the carrier head $\mathbf{1 4 0}$ may be rotated about the central axis $\mathbf{1 5 5}$ thereof and the movement of the carrier head $\mathbf{1 4 0}$ may be translated across an uppermost surface of the polishing pad $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ in a lateral direction.

Although only one carrier head $\mathbf{1 4 0}$ is shown in FIG. 1, two or more carrier heads may be provided to maintain additional substrates such that a surface area of the polishing pad $\mathbf{1 1 0}$ may be efficiently used.

The polishing apparatus $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ may also include a control system configured to control rotation of the platen $\mathbf{1 2 0}$. The control system may include a controller $\mathbf{1 9 0}$ such as a general-use programmable digital computer, an output device $\mathbf{1 9 2}$ such as a monitor, and an input device $\mathbf{1 9 4}$ such as a keyboard.

Although the control system is shown in FIG. 1 as being connected only to the motor $\mathbf{1 2 1}$, the control system may also be connected to the carrier head $\mathbf{1 4 0}$ and control a pressure or rotation speed of the carrier head $\mathbf{1 4 0}$. Furthermore, the control system may be connected to the slurry port 130 and control the supply of slurry.

An embodiment provides a slurry composition for chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), which may be used by the polishing apparatus 100.

The slurry composition for CMP may include a complex compound of fullerenol and alkylammonium hydroxide.

Polishing Particles
The polishing particles may include a complex compound 5 of both fullerenol represented by Chemical Formula 1 and alkylammonium hydroxide represented by Chemical Formula 2 .
$\mathrm{C}_{6}(\mathrm{OH})_{6}$
[Chemical Formula 1]
10 (where $p$ is an arbitrary integer ranging from 10 to $q$, and $q$ is $20,24,26,28,32,36,50,60,70,72,74,76,78,80,82$, $84,100$, or 200 ).
$\mathrm{R}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{4 n} \mathrm{~N}(\mathrm{OH})$ [Chemical Formula 2]
15 (where R is a C 1 to C 8 alkyl group, and x is an integer ranging from 1 to 4 ).

Hereinafter, each of the fullerenol and the alkylammonium hydroxide will be described in detail.
$<$ Fullerenol $>$
20
The fullerenol may be a derivative of fullerene, in which a large number of hydroxyl groups are bonded to a surface of the fullerene.

Clusters including a large number of carbon atoms having closed atomic shell shapes are collectively referred to as 25 fullerenes, and although buckminster fullerenes having 60 carbon atoms are representative fullerenes, there are fullerenes having various numbers of carbon atoms. For example, there are fullerenes having $20,24,26,28,32,36,50,60,70$, $72,74,76,78,80,82,84,100$, or 200 carbon atoms.
30 Generally, fullerenes are not dispersed well in an aqueous solvent such as water and are dispersed at relatively low solubility even in an organic solvent.

Fullerenols, in which a plurality of hydroxyl groups are bonded to fullerenes, may be dispersed relatively well in an aqueous solvent due to the hydroxyl groups having polarity and may also be monodispersed. In addition, when fullerenols are used as polishing particles of a slurry composition for CMP instead of oxide-based inorganic particles according to the related art, there are merits of a high material removal rate (MRR), low generation of defects such as scratches, and high degree of flatness of an obtained surface.

In some embodiments, the fullerenol of the fullerenol complex compound may have $60,70,72,74,76,78$, or 80 carbon atoms. In some embodiments, the fullerenol of the fullerenol complex compound may have about 30 to about 50 hydroxyl groups.

The fullerenol complex compound may be present in an amount of about 0.1 parts by weight to about 15 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of a dispersant. If the amount of the fullerenol is too low, a polishing rate may be too low. If the amount of the fullerenol is too high, it may be difficult to control a polishing rate, and a polished surface of insufficient quality (for example, dishing) may be obtained.

In some embodiments, the fullerenol included in the fullerenol complex compound may be dispersion-treated such that a surface of fullerenol is positively or negatively charged.

For example, to make the surface of the fullerenol positively charged, the fullerenol may be treated with at least one selected from the group consisting of amino acids, polyalkylene glycols, glucosamine compound-bonded polysaccharides, and amine group-containing polymers. However, the embodiments are not limited thereto.

In some embodiments, to make the surface of the fullerenol negatively charged, for example, the fullerenol may be treated with at least one selected from the group consisting

# US $10,829,690$ B2 

## 5

of carboxyl group-containing polymers and carboxyl groupcontaining organic acids. However, the embodiments are not limited thereto.

In some embodiments, the slurry composition for CMP may include two or more types of polishing particles and may include the fullerenol complex compound as one type of polishing particles. For example, the slurry composition for CMP may include about 0.1 parts by weight to about 10 parts by weight of the fullerenol complex compound as first polishing particles and about 0.1 parts by weight to about 10 parts by weight of oxide-based inorganic particles as second polishing particles, based on 100 parts by weight of an aqueous dispersant. In some embodiments, the second polishing particles may include at least one selected from among silica, ceria, zirconia, alumina, titania, barium titania, germania, mangania, and magnesia.

The slurry composition for CMP may further include a dispersant dispersing the polishing particles.

The dispersant may be any liquid capable of substantially uniformly dispersing the polishing particles without limitation. The dispersant may be an aqueous solvent or an organic solvent. More specifically, the dispersant may be an aqueous solvent such as water, deionized water, or ultrapure water. Optionally, the dispersant may be an organic solvent, such as a C 1 to C 15 aliphatic alcohol or the like, in particular, a polar organic solvent.
<alkylammonium Hydroxide>
The alkylammonium hydroxide may have a structure represented by Chemical Formula 2, and the functional group, R, may be a C1 to C8 alkyl group.

More specifically, the alkyl group set forth above may be methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, secbutyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, sec-pentyl, tert-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, isooctyl, sec-octyl, tert-octyl group, or the like, without being limited thereto.
x , which is the number of substituents in the alkylammonium hydroxide, may be an integer of 1 to 4 , in particular, 3 or 4 . In some embodiments, when x is an integer of between 2 to 4 , Rs may be identical to or different from each other.

The fullerenol complex compound described above may have a structure represented by Chemical Formula 3.

$$
\mathrm{C}_{6}(\mathrm{OH})_{8} \mathrm{R}_{n} \mathrm{H}_{4-x} \mathrm{~N}(\mathrm{OH}) \quad[\text { Chemical Formula } 3]
$$

(where p is an arbitrary integer ranging from 10 to $\mathrm{q} ; \mathrm{q}$ is $20,24,26,28,32,36,50,60,70,72,74,76,78,80,82,84$, 100 , or 200 ; R is a C 1 to C 8 alkyl group; and x is an integer ranging from 1 to 4 ).

The slurry composition for CMP may include both of the fullerenol complex compound represented by Chemical Formula 3 and the fullerenol represented by Chemical Formula 1. The fullerenol, which is not a complex compound, may be fullerenol that has not formed a complex compound yet in conjunction with the alkylammonium hydroxide, and this will be described below in more detail.

have a pH of about 1 to about 9 . In some embodiments, the slurry composition for CMP may have a pH of about 2 to about 7 . In some embodiments, the slurry composition for CMP may have a pH of about 4 to about 9 .

An acid solution and an alkali solution may be appropriately used to control the pH of the slurry composition. In some embodiments, the pH control agent may include an acid solution such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, carboxylic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, citric acid, oxalic acid, or tartaric acid, and/or an alkali solution such as calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, triethylamine, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, or ammonia, without being limited thereto.

embodiments, the amine compound may include diamines, triamines, tetramines, pentamines, hexamines, heptamines, or the like.

For example, the amine compound may include at least one selected from the group consisting of spermine, methanediamine, ethane-1,2-diamine, propane-1,3-diamine, butane-1,4-diamine, pentane-1,5-diamine, hexane-1,6-diamine, heptane-1,7-diamine, octane-1,8-diamine, diethylenetriamine, dipropylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine (TETA), tripropylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), pentaethylenehexamine (PEHA), hexaethyleneheptamine, bis(hexamethylene)triamine, N-(3-aminopropyl) ethylenediamine, $\mathrm{N}, \mathrm{N}^{\prime}$-bis(3-aminopropyl)ethylenediamine, $\mathrm{N}, \mathrm{N}^{\prime}$-bis(2-aminoethyl)-1,3-propanediamine, $\mathrm{N}, \mathrm{N}, \mathrm{N}^{\prime}$-tris(3aminopropyl)ethylenediamine, N -3-aminopropyl-1,3-diaminopropane, $\mathrm{N}, \mathrm{N}^{\prime}$-bis(3-aminopropyl)-1,3-diaminopropane, N,N,N'-tris(3-aminopropyl)-1,3-diaminopropane, bis-(3-aminopropyl)amine, $\mathrm{N}, \mathrm{N}, \mathrm{N}^{\prime} \mathrm{N}^{\prime}$-tetrakis(2-hydroxypropyl) ethylenediamine, $\mathrm{N}, \mathrm{N}, \mathrm{N}^{\prime}, \mathrm{N}^{\prime}$-tetramethylpropanediamine, di-t-butylethylenediamine, 3,3'-iminobis(propylamine), N -methyl-3,3'-iminobis(propylamine), $\mathrm{N}, \mathrm{N}^{\prime}$-bis(3-aminopropyl)-1,3-propylenediamine, $\mathrm{N}, \mathrm{N}^{\prime}$-bis(3-aminopropyl)-1, 4-butylenediamine, $\mathrm{N}, \mathrm{N}^{\prime}$-bis(4-aminobutyl)-1,4-butanediamine, $\mathrm{N}, \mathrm{N}^{\prime}$-bis (2-aminoethyl)-1,4-butanediamine, $\mathrm{N}, \mathrm{N}^{\prime}$-bis (2-aminoethyl)ethylenediamine, bis(3-aminopropyl)amine, bis(4-aminobutyl)amine, bis(5-aminopentyl)amine, N-(6aminohexyl)-1,6-hexanediamine, hexahydro-1,3,5-triazine, N -methylethylenediamine, N -ethylethylenediamine, N -propylethylenediamine, N-butylethylenediamine, N-methyl-1, 3-diaminopropane, N-methyl-1,4-diaminobutane, N-methyl-1,5-diaminopentane, N-methyl-1,6-diaminohexane, N-methyl-1,7-diaminoheptane, N-methyl-1,8-diaminooctane, N-methyl-1,9-diaminononane, N-methyl-1, 10-diaminodecane, N-methyl-1,11-diaminoundecane, N-methyl-1,12-diaminododecane, 1,3-bis(aminomethyl)cyclohexane, 1,4-bis(aminomethyl)cyclohexane, piperazine and derivatives thereof, without being limited thereto.

The amine compound may be present in an amount of about 0.001 wt $\%$ to about 1 wt $\%$ based on the total weight of the slurry composition for CMP. Alternatively, the amine compound may be present in an amount of about 0.005 wt $\%$ to about 0.5 wt $\%$ based on the total weight of the slurry composition for CMP. Alternatively, the amine compound may be present in an amount of about 0.01 wt $\%$ to about 0.1 wt $\%$ based on the total weight of the slurry composition for CMP.

If the amount of the amine compound in the slurry composition for CMP is too low, dishing may be severely generated. If the amount of the amine compound in the slurry composition for CMP is too high, the stability of the slurry composition for CMP may be deteriorated.

According to embodiments, the slurry composition for CMP, which includes the fullerenol-based polishing particles and exhibits excellent polishing properties, may be prepared at low cost and in large quantities.

Hereinafter, a method of preparing a slurry composition for CMP, according to embodiments, will be described.

FIG. 2 is a flowchart illustrating a method of preparing a slurry composition for CMP, according to an embodiment.

FIGS. 3A to 3F are conceptual diagrams schematically illustrating the method of preparing a slurry composition for CMP.

Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3A, a mixture of an organic solvent and fullerene, which constitute a first phase I, and a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and an aqueous dispersant, which constitute a second phase II, are supplied into a reaction vessel 300 (S110).

Since the aqueous dispersant (for example, deionized water) and the organic solvent (for example, toluene) are immiscible with each other, the phases are separated according to specific gravities. In FIG. 3A, the first phase I is shown as being located above the second phase II. Since the fullerene is present only in the first phase I, the first phase I may be opaque, and the second phase II may be transparent.

Next, as a phase transfer catalyst provoking a two phase reaction, an alkyammonium hydroxide (AAH) may be supplied into the reaction vessel 300 .

Next, referring to FIG. 3B, the materials in the reaction vessel 300 are stirred by using a stirrer 301, which is driven by a stirring driver 303, thereby mixing the first phase I with the second phase II and preparing fullerenol and a fullerenol complex compound. By the stirring driven by a stirring driver 303, a chemical reaction and mass transfer occur between the first phase I and the second phase II while the first phase I and the second phase II have a larger contact 20 area therebetween.

Specifically, since the fullerene ( $\boldsymbol{\sim}$ ) in the first phase I is dispersible in the organic solvent and not dispersible in the aqueous dispersant, the fullerene ( $\boldsymbol{\sim}$ ) is not diffused in the second phase II. The fullerene ( $\boldsymbol{\sim}$ ) may react with the alkyammonium hydroxide $(\Delta)$ in the first phase I and thus form fullerenol ( $\boldsymbol{\sim}$ ).

Since the fullerenol ( $\boldsymbol{\sim} \infty$ ) is dispersed well even in the aqueous dispersant due to a hydroxyl group ( $\leftrightharpoons$ ), the fullerenol ( $\boldsymbol{\sim} \infty$ ) may be actively diffused in the second phase II. The fullerenol ( $\boldsymbol{\sim} \infty$ ) diffused in the second phase II reacts with hydrogen peroxide ( $\diamond$ ), whereby the number of hydroxyl groups bonded to a surface of the fullerene is increased. The fullerenol ( $\boldsymbol{\sim} \infty$ ) having an increased number of hydroxyl groups forms a complex compound in conjunction with the alkyammonium hydroxide $(\Delta)$ that is also present in the second phase II. Unreacted hydrogen peroxide $(\diamond)$ not involved in the reaction may be present in the second phase II.

The reaction set forth above may be performed at an increased temperature, for example, a temperature of about $50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. to about $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$., for 5 hours to about 25 hours.

If the reaction temperature is too low, there may be an economic drawback due to a low reaction rate. If the reaction temperature is too high, the yield of a wanted product may be reduced due to a side reaction. If the reaction time is too short, a product may not be sufficiently produced. If the reaction time is too long, there is an economic drawback due to almost no additional reaction caused by saturation of the reaction.

Referring to FIG. 3C, when the first phase I and the second phase II are stabilized and thus separated up and down again from each other (e.g., second phase II below the first phase I), there may be almost no fullerene ( $\boldsymbol{\sim}$ ) in the first phase I. In the second phase II, the fullerenol ( $\boldsymbol{\sim} \infty$ ), the fullerenol complex compound, and unreacted hydrogen peroxide ( $\diamond$ ) are mixed. Since the fullerenol and the fullerenol complex compound are present in the second phase II, the second phase II may be opaque, and the first phase I may be transparent.

Next, the first phase I may be removed, and only the second phase II may remain.

Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3D, a hydrogen peroxide decomposition catalyst CAT may be introduced into the second phase II (S120).

The hydrogen peroxide decomposition catalyst CAT may be solid particles that have a diameter of about 0.01 mm to about 5 mm . However, solid particles having smaller sizes

than the diameter set forth above may also be used as long as they can be separated and removed afterward with ease. In addition, the hydrogen peroxide decomposition catalyst CAT having a larger diameter than 5 mm may also be used as long as a sufficient reaction rate is achieved. The diameters of the particles referenced herein may be a 'particle diameter' indicating a distance between two farthest points of each particle, and/or an 'average diameter' of the particles that indicates an arithmetic average of particle diameters of the particles.

The hydrogen peroxide decomposition catalyst CAT may include manganese dioxide $\left(\mathrm{MnO}_{2}\right)$ or a noble metal. The noble metal may include at least one selected from the group consisting of platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), nickel (Ni), ruthenium (Ru), rhodium (Rh), silver (Ag), iridium (Ir), gold (Au), rhenium (Re), titanium (Ti), and tantalum (Ta). In addition, the noble metal may be used while being supported on a carrier such as alumina $\left(\mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$.

Although a mechanism, by which the hydrogen peroxide decomposition catalyst CAT decomposes and removes hydrogen peroxide, may be represented by Reaction Formula 1 and Reaction Formula 2, it is not intended to limit the embodiments to a specific theory.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow 2 e^{-} \\
& \text { [Reaction Formula 1] } \\
& \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow 2 e^{-} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
\end{aligned}
$$

[Reaction Formula 2]
Hydrogen peroxide may be removed from the mixture by the above reaction.

Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3E, the hydrogen peroxide decomposition catalyst CAT may be separated and removed by filtration (S130).

The mixture obtained in FIG. 3D may be passed through a filter 310 and a collector 312, thereby obtaining the mixture, from which the hydrogen peroxide decomposition catalyst CAT is removed, in a collection container 320. In the mixture collected in the collection container 320, the fullerenol and the fullerenol complex compound may be dispersed in the aqueous dispersant.

Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3F, a polishing additive may be added into the mixture, thereby obtaining a slurry composition for CMP (S140).

For example, the polishing additive may include at least one selected from among a pH control agent, a polishing accelerator, an oxidizer, a dispersion stabilizer, a surfactant, a polishing inhibitor, a leveling agent, a corrosion inhibitor, and an amine compound. However, the embodiments are not limited thereto.

As described above, since hydrogen peroxide may be removed from the mixture in a simple and efficient manner, the fullerenol (and the complex compound thereof) may be prepared in a simple and low-cost manner.

According to the related art, to obtain fullerenol, a twostep method has been used, in which a surface of fullerene is partially hydroxylated first in an organic solvent, followed by separating the fullerene and bonding a large number of hydroxyl groups to the fullerene in an aqueous dispersant by using hydrogen peroxide.

According to the method of the related art, since synthesis of the fullerenol is cumbersome, and processes of centrifuging and cleaning the fullerenol by using a high-priced organic solvent are repeated to separate the final fullerenol from hydrogen peroxide, processes are complicated and cumbersome, and high cost is incurred. On the other hand, as described above, according to the disclosed embodiments, since the fullerenol is synthesized in one pot and separated in situ from hydrogen peroxide by chemical decomposition
of hydrogen peroxide, the fullerenol (and the complex compound thereof) may be prepared in a simple and lowcost manner.

Hereinafter, although the concepts will be described in more detail with reference to specific examples and comparative examples, these examples are provided merely for clear understanding and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventive concepts.
1.00 g of C60 fullerene ( $96 \%$ or more, Frontier Carbon Co., Ltd.) was dispersed in 500 ml of toluene, followed by adding 50 ml of a $30 \%$ hydrogen peroxide solution and a $40 \%$ tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide (TBAH) aqueous solution as a phase transfer catalyst to the suspension. Then, the components were stirred at $70^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. for 16 hours.

Next, a toluene layer was removed, thereby obtaining an aqueous solution in which fullerenol was dispersed. 10 g of manganese dioxide was added to the aqueous solution, followed by leaving alone the aqueous solution for 10 hours. Then, manganese dioxide particles were removed by filtration, thereby obtaining a fullerenol complex compound.

Next, an amount of polishing particles for each of Examples and Comparative Examples was adjusted as listed in Table 1, thereby obtaining compositions according to Examples and Comparative Examples.

After each slurry composition for CMP was prepared according to components and amounts thereof for each of Examples and Comparative Examples, polishing properties of each of the slurry compositions for CMP were evaluated on a specimen.

The specimen, on which an MIT854 pattern having a Ta/TaN barrier layer and Cu wiring lines in a TE/OS dielectric was formed, was prepared to a size of $2 \mathrm{~cm} \times 2 \mathrm{~cm}$ and used. In particular, dishing was evaluated on a Cu line-andspace pattern in which lines respectively having a width of $100 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ were arranged at intervals of $100 \mu \mathrm{~m}$.

An MA-200e polishing machine (Musashino Denshi Co., Ltd.) was used for polishing, and polishing was performed at a rotational speed of 90 rpm at a polishing pressure of 24 kPa by using an IC1010 polishing pad (Dow Chemical Co., Ltd.).

A dishing amount and a polishing rate were measured, and results are shown in Table 2.

As shown in Table 2, when the fullerenol was used (Comparative Examples 1 to 3), it was confirmed that dishing was improved as well as the removal rate was increased, as compared with Comparative Examples 4 to 6 using colloidal silica. Specifically, there were increases of $45 \%$ (Comparative Example 1), 38\% (Comparative Example 2), and $21 \%$ (Comparative Example 3) in the removal rate, and reductions of $58 \%$ to $60 \%$ in dishing, as compared with Comparative Examples 4 to 6 , respectively.

In addition, when the fullerenol complex compound was used (Examples 1 to 3), it was confirmed that dishing was significantly improved and the removal rate was slightly increased, as compared with Comparative Examples 1 to 3 using the fullerenol. Specifically, there were increases of $1 \%$ (Example 1), 5.3\% (Example 2), and 10\% (Example 3) in the removal rate, and reductions of $34 \%$ to $36 \%$ in dishing, as compared with Comparative Examples 1 to 3 , respectively.

Hereinafter, the fabrication of a semiconductor device by using the slurry composition for CMP will be described.

FIG. 4 is a plan view of a semiconductor device 200 provided on a semiconductor substrate.

FIGS. 5A to 5 F are cross-sectional views illustrating sequential processes of a method of fabricating a semiconductor device, according to an embodiment. In each of FIGS. 5A to 5F, a $\mathrm{YY}^{\prime}$ cross-section and a $\mathrm{WW}^{\prime}$ crosssection, respectively corresponding to the $\mathrm{YY}^{\prime}$ cross-section and the WW' cross-section of FIG. 4, are shown. As discussed more fully below, the embodiment disclosed in FIGS. 5A to 5 F illustrate a method of fabricating a semiconductor device that includes providing a pattern (e.g., a semiconductor pattern) that defines a trench, then forming a metal material film on the semiconductor pattern to fill the trench. In addition, the method includes performing chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) of the metal material film using the slurry composition for CMP such that the metal material film may be defined within the trench. For example, the metal material film may be removed from areas other than the trench, and thus may remain only within the trench.

Referring to FIGS. 4 and 5A, the semiconductor device 200 includes a fin-type active region FA protruding from a substrate 202.

Referring to FIG. 5A, a dummy gate electrode $\mathbf{2 2 0} d$ may be formed on the substrate 202 in which the fin-type active region FA is defined by a device isolation film 210, followed by conformally depositing a spacer material film $\mathbf{2 4 2} m$ on entire surfaces of the substrate 202 and the dummy gate electrode $\mathbf{2 2 0} d$.

The substrate 202 may include at least one of a Group III-V material and a Group IV material. The Group III-V material may be a binary, ternary, or quaternary compound including at least one Group III element and at least one Group V element. The Group III-V material may be a compound including at least one of $\mathrm{In}, \mathrm{Ga}$, and Al as a Group

III element and at least one of As, P, and Sb as a Group V element. For example, the Group III-V material may be selected from InP, $\mathrm{In}_{4} \mathrm{Ga}_{1-x} \mathrm{As}\left(0 \pm \mathrm{z} \leq 1\right.$ ), and $\mathrm{Al}_{4} \mathrm{Ga}_{1-x} \mathrm{As}$ ( $0 \pm \mathrm{z} \leq 1$ ). For example, the binary compound may be one of InP, GaAs, InAs, InSb, and GaSb. The ternary compound may be one of InGaP, InGaAs, AlInAs, InGaSb, GaAsSb, and GaAsP. The Group IV material may be Si and/or Ge. However, the Group III-V material and the Group IV material, which may be used to form a semiconductor device, are not limited to the examples set forth above.

The Group III-V material and the Group IV material such as Ge may be used as a channel material allowing a low-power high-speed transistor to be made. A high-performance complemental metal-on-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) may be formed by using a semiconductor substrate including a Group III-V material, for example, GaAs, which has a higher electron mobility than Si , and using a semiconductor substrate including a semiconductor material, for example, Ge, which has a higher hole mobility than Si. In some embodiments, when it is intended to form an N-type channel in the substrate 202, the substrate 202 may include one of the examples of Group III-V materials set forth above or include SiC. In some other embodiments, when it is intended to form a P-type channel in the substrate 202, the substrate 202 may include SiGe.

The dummy gate electrode $\mathbf{2 2 0} d$ may include, for example, polysilicon, without being limited thereto. The dummy gate electrode $\mathbf{2 2 0} d$ may be provided to secure both a location and a space, in which a gate electrode is to be formed later.

The spacer material film $\mathbf{2 4 2} m$ may include a low-K material film. In some embodiments, the spacer material film 242 m may include a SiOCN material film. In some embodiments, the spacer material film 242 m may include a single material film including SiOCN. In some embodiments, the spacer material film 242 m may include a multiple material film in which two or more material films including SiOCN are stacked.

Referring to FIG. 5B, a spacer 242 is formed by anisotropically etching the spacer material film 242 m . The spacer 242 may be formed on a sidewall of the dummy gate electrode 220d. In addition, the spacer 242 may be formed on a sidewall of the fin-type active region FA on both sides of the dummy gate electrode 220d.

Referring to FIG. 5C, the fin-type active region FA may be partially removed by using the dummy gate electrode 220d and the spacer 242 as an etch mask.

To partially remove the fin-type active region FA, anisotropic etching and/or isotropic etching may be performed. In particular, to expose at least a portion of a bottom surface of the spacer 242 formed on the sidewall of the dummy gate electrode 220d, partial etching of the fin-type active region 55 FA may be performed by combining anisotropic etching and isotropic etching.

More specifically, the exposed fin-type active region FA may be anisotropically etched by as much as a predetermined depth and then may be isotropically etched by wet etching. An etchant for wet etching may include, for example, an $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{OH}$ solution, tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH), an HF solution, an $\mathrm{NH}_{4} \mathrm{~F}$ solution, or a mixture thereof. However, the etchant is not limited thereto.

A recess may be formed by anisotropic etching using the spacer 242 as an etch mask, and wet etching may be performed on the recess, thereby obtaining a recess R, which exposes a portion of the bottom surface of the spacer 242, as

shown in FIG. 5C. In particular, the recess R may expose at least a portion of the bottom surface of the spacer 242 at an impurity region side.

In some embodiments, wet etching performed to expose the portion of the bottom surface of the spacer 242 may be omitted.

Next, to form an impurity region 230, a source/drain material layer may be formed in the recess R. Although the source/drain material layer may include $\mathrm{Si}, \mathrm{SiC}, \mathrm{SiP}$, or SiGe , the embodiments are not limited thereto. The source/ drain material layer may be formed, for example, by epitaxial growth. Impurities may be implanted in situ during epitaxial growth of the source/drain material layer, or may be implanted by ion implantation after forming the source/ drain material layer. In addition, a top surface of the impurity region 230 may be at a higher level than a top surface of the fin-type active region FA.

Next, an interlayer dielectric 244 may be formed on the impurity region 230. The interlayer dielectric 244 may include, for example, silicon oxide, without being limited thereto.

Referring to FIG. 5D, a gate trench GT may be formed by removing the dummy gate electrode 220d. A portion of a top surface of the substrate 202 may be exposed by the gate trench GT. The portion of the substrate 202 exposed by the gate trench GT may correspond to a channel region of the semiconductor device 200 that is to be fabricated afterward.

The dummy gate electrode 220d may be removed, for example, by dry etching or wet etching.

Referring to FIG. 5E, an interfacial layer 212 may be formed. Next, a high-K material film 214f, a first metalcontaining material film 226 Af , a second metal-containing material film 226 Bf , and a gap-fill metal material film 228f are formed, in this stated order, on the interfacial layer 212, a sidewall of the gate trench GT, and a top surface of the interlayer dielectric 244. In particular, the high-K material film 214f, the first metal-containing material film 226Af, and the second metal-containing material film 226 Bf may be conformally formed along each of surfaces of the interfacial layer 212, the gate trench GT, and the interlayer dielectric 244. In addition, the gap-fill metal material film 228f may be formed to fill a trench formed by the second metal-containing material film 226 Bf .

Each of the high-K material film 214f, the first metalcontaining material film 226 Af , the second metal-containing material film 226 Bf , and the gap-fill metal material film 228f may be independently formed by an atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), or physical vapor deposition (PVD) process. However, the embodiments are not limited thereto.

The high-K material film 214f may include a material having a higher dielectric constant than a silicon oxide film. For example, the high-K material film 214f may have a dielectric constant of about 10 to about 25 .
