## LIQUID DISPERSION AND POWDER OF CERIUM BASED CORE-SHELL PARTICLES, PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME AND USES THEREOF IN POLISHING

[0001] This application claims priority filed on 26 Nov. 2019 in EUROPE Nr 19306524.0, the whole content of this application being incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.

## TECHNICAL FIELD

[0002] The present invention relates to a process for producing a dispersion of cerium based core-shell particles, to the dispersions and powders obtainable by such a process, and to their use in the field of polishing, especially chemical mechanical polishing.

## BACKGROUND ART

[0003] Ceric oxides are commonly used for polishing applications, especially chemical mechanical polishing. The development of the electronics industry requires an increasingly considerable use of compositions for polishing various parts such as discs or dielectric compounds. These compositions, which are generally in the form of dispersions, must exhibit a certain number of characteristics. For example, they must offer a high degree of removal of material, which reflects their abrasive capacity. They must also have a defectuosity which is as low as possible; the term "defectuosity" is intended to mean in particular the amount of scratches exhibited by the substrate once treated with the composition. For reasons of stability and of ease of use, these dispersions must comprise particles of submicronic dimensions, i.e. generally less than 300 nm . In addition, the presence of particles that are too fine in these dispersions reduces their abrasive capacities, and particles that are too large can contribute to an increase in the defectuosity.
[0004] In this context, we believe that there is a need for cerium based particles having improved abrasive properties when used in a chemical mechanical polishing process. There is also a need for a making process thereof which is simple and easy to implement at an industrial scale.

## BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

[0005] These problems are solved by the present invention which offers inter alia new cerium based particles having a rough surface thanks to a specific core-shell morphology and a making process thereof.
[0006] One object of the invention thus relates to a process for producing a dispersion of cerium based core-shell particles in a liquid, comprising the following steps:
[0007] (a) providing an aqueous dispersion comprising particles of cerium oxide optionally doped with at least one metal (M); providing an aqueous solution comprising a cerium (III) salt; and optionally providing an aqueous solution comprising at least one metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\mathrm{i}}\right)$ salt;
[0008] (b) contacting, under oxidizing atmosphere, the aqueous dispersion with the aqueous solution(s) provided in step (a), while maintaining the temperature comprised between $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and the pH lower or equal to 11 , to produce the dispersion of cerium based core-shell particles;
[0009] at least one of the steps (a) and (b) being carried out in the presence of nitrate ions.
[0010] The invention also relates to the cerium based core-shell particles and dispersions thereof obtainable or obtained by this process.
[0011] A cerium based core-shell particle of the invention can be described as a core particle of cerium oxide optionally doped with at least one metal (M) and a shell consisting of a plurality of nanoparticles of cerium oxide optionally doped with at least one metal ( $\mathrm{M}^{\mathrm{i}}$ ), said nanoparticles being formed on the surface of the core particle, wherein the ratio of the average size of the core-shell particles measured by TEM to the average size of the core-shell particles measured by BET is of at least 1.5 .
[0012] Advantageously, the specific core-shell morphology of the particles of the invention increases their surface roughness and thus their surface specific area by comparison with smooth cerium oxide particles not having a shell in accordance with the present invention. Accordingly, by increasing the contact surface between the particles and the substrate to be polished, the abrasive properties of the core-shell particles of the invention are improved, allowing to advantageously use them in a chemical mechanical polishing process. The core-shell particles dispersions of the invention especially allow a higher removal rate due to their rough surface while maintaining the same defectivity thanks to equivalent size distributions compared to dispersions of smooth surface cerium oxide particles having no shell in accordance with the present invention.
[0013] The dispersions of cerium based core-shell particles of the invention can be used to prepare powders of cerium based core-shell particles, as well as polishing compositions, as it will be detailed hereafter in the specification.
[0014] Additionally, one advantage of the core-shell particles of the invention is that the nanoparticles from the shell are well attached to the core particle. It has notably been observed that they remain attached to the core during the whole chemical mechanical polishing process in which they are implemented. It is all the more important since the particles shells withstand the mechanical stress during the chemical mechanical polishing process. If the nanoparticles of the shell came off during the polishing, these small cerium oxide particles could remain attached to the substrate even after a washing step, which is not acceptable by the end users. It would result in unacceptable costs due to the substrate loss and the recurrent polishing composition replacement.
[0015] Another advantage of the core-shell particles of the invention lies in the fact they have the adapted size range for the CMP application and are monodisperse.

## Definitions

[0027] In the present disclosure, the expression "comprising" should be understood as meaning "comprising at least one".
[0028] When referring to the aqueous dispersion or solution provided in step (a) and (b) of the process of the invention, the expression "comprising" encompasses the embodiments wherein said dispersion and solution "consist of" the compounds described in connection thereof.
[0029] The expression "comprised between . . . and . . ." should be understood as including the limits.
[0030] In the whole description, the term "cerium based" encompasses cerium oxide and metal doped cerium oxide. Cerium oxide generally has a purity degree of at least $99.8 \%$ by weight with respect to the weight of the oxide. Cerium oxide is generally crystalline ceric oxide. The term "cerium oxide doped with at least one metal" means that metal ions partially replace the cerium ions in the $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ lattice. Therefore, it also denotes a mixed oxide of cerium and at least one metal. It may also denote, in some embodiments, a solid solution. In that case, the metal atoms are intimately diffused into the cerium oxide crystalline structure. Some impurities other than said metal can be present in the oxide. The impurities may stem from the raw materials or starting materials used in the process of preparation of the metal doped oxide. The total proportion of the impurities is generally lower than $0.2 \%$ by weight with respect to the metal doped oxide. Residual nitrates are not considered as impurities in this application.
[0031] The expression "dispersion" in connection with dispersions of cerium based particles denotes a system
consisting of solid fine particles of submicronic dimensions, stably dispersed in a liquid medium, it being possible for said particles to also optionally contain residual amounts of bound or adsorbed ions such as, for example, nitrates or ammoniums.
[0032] The term "nanoparticle" in connection with the plurality of small particles forming the shell of the core-shell particles of the invention means that these small particles have an average particle size comprised between 1 and 100 nm . It can especially be determined by TEM as explained hereinafter.
[0033] Different parameters may be used to characterize the sizes and the distribution of sizes of:
[0034] the whole core-shell particles of the invention;
[0035] the core particles, notably by characterizing the particles provided in the dispersion of step (a) of the process of the invention;
[0036] the nanoparticles from the shell.
[0037] In connection with dispersions of particles:
[0038] the average size of $\mathrm{n}(>100)$ particles may be measured using a photograph of dispersions thereof obtained by transmission electron microscopy (TEM);
[0039] the standard deviation mentioned in the present application is also determined from the TEM method. It has its usual mathematical meaning. It is the square root of the variance and is expressed by the formula:

$$
\sigma=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(s_{i}-\bar{x}\right)^{2}}
$$

[0040] n being the number of particles taken into account in the measurement,
[0041] $\mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{i}}$ being the size of a particle i ,
[0042] $\overline{\mathrm{x}}$ being the average value of the size of the particles $\left(1 / n \Sigma_{i} \mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$.
[0043] In connection with particles in the powder form (dried particles):
[0044] the average size of the particles may be determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. The value measured by XRD corresponds to the size of the coherent range calculated based on the breadth of the two most intense diffraction lines and using the Scherrer model;
[0045] the specific surface area may be determined on a powder by adsorption of nitrogen by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method (BET method). The method is disclosed in standard ASTM D 3663-03 (reapproved 2015). The method is also described in the periodical "The Journal of the American Chemical Society, 60, 309 (1938)". The specific surface area may be determined automatically with an appliance TriStar 3000 of Micromeritics according to the guidelines of the constructor. Prior to the measurement, the samples in the form of powders shall be degassed under static air by heating at a temperature of at most $210^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. to remove the adsorbed species.
[0046] the average size of particles estimated by BET is the theoretical average size of the particles obtained from the specific surface area measured by the BET method and assuming the particles are non-porous spherical particles of cerium oxide having a density of 7.2.

[0047] The distribution of sizes of the particles may be characterized by various parameters. Said parameters are based on distributions by volume and not by number:
[0048] the hydrodynamic mean diameter Dh which is equivalent to a median diameter D50 of the particles may be determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS). This technique allows measurement of the hydrodynamic mean diameter Dh of the solid objects, the value of which is affected by the presence of aggregates of particles. Therefore, the measurement is usually performed on a dispersion of the particles in water. Dh is determined with the appliance Zetasizer Nano-ZS of Malvern following the guidelines of the constructor. The sample usually needs to be diluted in deionized water. A dilution factor of $\times 30000$ may be applied;
[0049] laser diffraction may also be used to determine the distribution of sizes of the particles. A laser particle sizer like Horiba LA-910 may be used following the guidelines of the constructor. For the measurement, a relative refractive index of 1.7 may be used. From the distribution in volume obtained by laser diffraction, various parameters usually used in statistics like D10, D50, D90 and dispersion index may be deducted.
[0050] D10 is the diameter determined from a distribution obtained by laser diffraction for which $10 \%$ of the particles have a diameter of less than D10.
[0051] D50 is the median diameter determined from a distribution obtained by laser diffraction.
[0052] D90 is the diameter determined from a distribution obtained by laser diffraction for which $90 \%$ of the particles have a diameter of less than D90.
[0053] The "dispersion index" is defined by the following formula $\alpha / \mathrm{m}=\left(\mathrm{D} 90-\mathrm{D} 10\right) / 2 \mathrm{D} 50$.

## DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

[0054] The present invention relates to a process for producing a dispersion of cerium based core-shell particles in a liquid, preferably water, comprising the following steps:

[0070] According to this embodiment, said metal (M) may be more particularly chosen from the group consisting of alkali metal elements, alkaline earth metal elements, rare earth elements, actinide elements, transition metal elements and post transition metal elements, from the Periodic Table.
[0071] The expression "rare earth" is understood to mean the elements from the group made up of yttrium and the elements from the Periodic Table with atomic numbers between 57 and 71 inclusive. Transition metal elements are defined as any element in the d-block of the Periodic Table, which includes groups 3 to 12 on the periodic table. Post transition metal elements, also known as poor metal, are

defined as metallic elements in the p-block of the Periodic Table, notably aluminium, gallium, indium, thallium, tin, lead, bismuth and polonium.

More preferably, said at least one metal (M) is chosen from the group consisting of lanthanum, praseodymium, neodymium and zirconium. Still more preferably, said at least one metal (M) is chosen from the group consisting of lanthanum, praseodymium and neodymium. Even more preferably, said at least one metal (M) is lanthanum.
[0073] Still according to this embodiment, the molar ratio $\mathrm{M} / \mathrm{M}+\mathrm{Ce}$ in the metal (M) doped cerium oxide particles used in step (a) may be comprised between 0.01 and 0.15 , more particularly between 0.01 and 0.13 , in particular between 0.01 and 0.12 .

[0083] Such particles can especially be manufactured as described in WO 2018/229005.
[0084] The temperature of the dispersion of cerium based particles provided in step (a) may be set up, prior to step (b),

It is preferable to set up the required temperature while stirring the dispersion. Stirring may be started before adjusting the temperature.
[0085] As well, the pH of the dispersion of cerium based particles provided in step (a) may be set up at a value, prior to step (b), lower or equal to 11 , preferably comprised between 3 and 11, preferably between 4 and 11, preferably between 8 and 11, more preferably between 8 and 10 , particularly between 8 and 9 , more particularly about 9 . A pH adjuster may be used in that respect. Depending on the initial pH of the dispersion, the pH adjuster can be an acid or a base. As suitable acid, mention can be made of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfonic acid, carbonic acid, picolinic acid, propionic acid, and mixtures thereof, being preferably nitric acid. As suitable base, mention can be made of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides and aqueous ammonia. Secondary, tertiary or quaternary amines can also be used. Aqueous ammonia is preferred.
[0086] According to a preferred embodiment, the pH adjuster is a base, preferably aqueous ammonia.
[0087] Preparation of the Core Particles Provided in Step (a)
[0088] According to one embodiment, the cerium based particles used in step (a) are prepared by a method based on the precipitation of a cerium (III) salt and a cerium (IV) salt. This method comprises the following steps:
[0089] (a') contacting under an inert atmosphere, an aqueous solution of a base and an aqueous solution comprising $\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-}, \mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{III}), \mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{IV})$ and optionally at least one metal (M); [0090] (b') subjecting the mixture obtained in step (a') to a thermal treatment under an inert atmosphere;
[0091] (c') the mixture obtained at the end of step (b') may optionally be acidified;
[0092] (d') the solid material obtained at the end of step (b') or step (c') may optionally be washed with water;
[0093] ( $\mathrm{e}^{\prime}$ ) the solid material obtained at the end of step (d') may optionally be subjected to a mechanical treatment to deagglomerate the particles.
[0094] The $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{IV})$ /total Ce molar ratio in step (a') may be comprised between 1/500 000 and 1/4000. It may generally be between $1 / 90000$ and $1 / 100000$.
[0095] If at least one metal (M) is provided in step (a'), its appropriate amount is determined in order to get a molar ratio $\mathrm{M} / \mathrm{M}+\mathrm{Ce}$ in the metal (M) doped cerium oxide particles produced according to this embodiment comprised between 0.01 and 0.15 , more particularly between 0.01 and 0.12 .
[0096] The metal (M), if present in the aqueous solution of step (a'), is provided by a salt which may be a metal (M) nitrate, chloride, sulfate, phosphate, acetate or carbonate, and also mixtures of these salts, such as mixed nitrates/ chlorides. It is preferably a metal (M) nitrate. The metal (M) is such as defined in the above description in connection with step (a) of the process of the invention.
[0097] The amount of nitrate ions in the aqueous solution used in step (a'), expressed by the $\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-} / \mathrm{Ce}$ (III) molar ratio is generally between $1 / 3$ and $5 / 1$.
[0098] The acidity of the aqueous solution used in step (a') is chosen so as to have the cerium (III) entirely present in solution. It is preferably comprised between 0.8 N and 12.0 N .

[0099] Cerium (IV) may be provided in step (a') by a salt which may be cerium (IV) nitrate, sulfate, cerium ammonium nitrate, cerium ammonium sulfate. It is preferably cerium (IV) nitrate. A ceric nitrate solution can advantageously be obtained according to the method of electrolytic oxidation of a cerous nitrate solution as disclosed in FR 2570087. A solution of ceric nitrate obtained according to the teaching of FR 2570087 may exhibit an acidity of around 0.6 N .
[0100] Cerium (III) may be provided in step (a') by a salt which may be cerium (III) nitrate, chloride, sulfate, phosphate, acetate or carbonate, and also mixtures of these salts, such as mixed nitrates/chlorides. It is preferably cerium (III) nitrate.
[0101] The amount of free oxygen in the starting solution in step (a') should be carefully controlled and minimized. To this end, the starting solution may be degassed by bubbling with an inert gas. The term "inert gas" or "inert atmosphere" is intended to mean an atmosphere or a gas free of oxygen, it being possible for the gas to be, for example, nitrogen or argon.
[0102] As base used in step (a'), products of the hydroxide type can in particular be used. Mention may be made of alkali metal or alkaline earth metal hydroxides and aqueous ammonia. Secondary, tertiary or quaternary amines can also be used. The aqueous solution of the base can also be degassed beforehand by bubbling with an inert gas. The amount of the base used in step ( $\mathrm{a}^{\prime}$ ), expressed by the molar ratio base/(Cewoptional M), is preferably comprised between 8.0 and 30.0 . This ratio may preferably be higher than 9.0 .
[0103] Step (a') may be generally carried out at a temperature comprised between $5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and $50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. This temperature may be $20-25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
[0104] Step ( $\mathrm{b}^{\prime}$ ) is a thermal treatment of the reaction medium obtained at the end of the preceding step. It consists in (i) an heating substep and (ii) in an aging substep. The heating substep (i) consists in heating the medium at a temperature which is generally comprised between $75^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and $95^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$., more particularly between $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and $90^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$., even more particularly between $85^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and $90^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
[0105] The aging substep (ii) consists in maintaining the medium at a temperature comprised between $75^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and $95^{\circ}$ C., more particularly between $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and $90^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$., even more particularly between $85^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and $90^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The duration of the aging substep (ii) is between 2 hours to 20 hours. The higher the temperature of the aging step, the lower the duration of the aging substep. For instance, when the temperature of the aging substep is between $85^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and $90^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$., eg. $88^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$., the duration of the aging substep may be between 2 hours and 15 hours, more particularly between 4 hours and 15 hours. When the temperature of the aging substep is between $75^{\circ}$ C. and $85^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$., eg. $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$., the duration of the aging substep may be between 15 hours and 30 hours.
[0106] During step (b'), the oxidation of Ce (III) to Ce (IV) occurs. This step may also be carried out under an inert atmosphere. The description with respect to the atmosphere for step (a') applies herein.
[0107] In step ( $\mathrm{c}^{\prime}$ ), the mixture obtained at the end of step (b') may optionally be acidified. This step ( $\mathrm{c}^{\prime}$ ) may be performed by using nitric acid. The reaction mixture may be acidified by $\mathrm{HNO}_{3}$ to a pH lower than 3.0 , more particularly comprised between 1.5 and 2.5 .
[0108] In step ( $\mathrm{d}^{\prime}$ ), the solid material obtained at the end of step ( $\mathrm{b}^{\prime}$ ) or step ( $\mathrm{c}^{\prime}$ ) may be washed with water, preferably deionized water. This operation makes it possible to decrease the amount of residual anions, especially nitrates, in the dispersion and to obtain the targeted conductivity. This step may be carried out by filtering the solid from the mixture and redispersing the solid in water. Filtration and redispersion may be performed several times if necessary.
[0109] In step ( $\mathrm{e}^{\prime}$ ), the solid material obtained at the end of step (d) may be subjected to a mechanical treatment to deagglomerate the particles. The step may be carried out by a double jet treatment or ultrasonic deagglomeration. This step usually leads to a sharp particle size distribution and to a reduction of the number of large agglomerated particles. According to an embodiment, the cerium based particles are subjected to the mechanical treatment of deagglomeration. According to another embodiment, the cerium based particles are not subjected to the mechanical treatment of deagglomeration.
[0110] After step ( $\mathrm{e}^{\prime}$ ), the solid material may be dried to obtain the cerium based particles to be provided in step (a) in the powder form. After step ( $\mathrm{e}^{\prime}$ ), water may also be added to obtain directly the aqueous dispersion of cerium based particles to be provided in step (a).
[0111] Aqueous Solution(s) Provided in Step (a)
[0112] The aqueous solution comprising a cerium (III) salt and the optional aqueous solution comprising at least one metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\prime}\right)$ salt purpose is to form the nanoparticles of the shell of the cerium based core-shell particles to be produced.
[0113] Cerium (III) salt may be cerium (III) nitrate, chloride, sulfate, phosphate or carbonate, and also mixtures of these salts, such as mixed nitrates/chlorides. It is preferably cerium (III) nitrate.
[0114] The nitrate ions can be provided in any of steps (a) or (b). The amount of nitrate ions, expressed by the $\mathrm{NO}_{3}{ }^{-} /$ Ce (III) molar ratio, is generally between $1 / 3$ and $5 / 1$.
[0115] The acidity of the aqueous solution comprising the cerium (III) salt provided in step (a) is chosen so as to have the cerium (III) entirely present in solution. It is preferably comprised between 0.8 N and 12.0 N . A suitable acid may be used in that respect, such as nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfonic acid, carbonic acid, picolinic acid, propionic acid and mixtures thereof, being preferably nitric acid.
[0116] It is advantageous to use salts and ingredients of high purity. The purity of the salts may be at least $99.5 \% \mathrm{wt}$, more particularly of at least $99.9 \% \mathrm{wt}$.
[0117] According to one embodiment wherein it is desired to get a shell of metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\prime}\right)$ doped cerium oxide, an aqueous solution comprising at least one metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\prime}\right)$ salt is also provided in step (a). The metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\prime}\right)$ salt may be a metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\prime}\right)$ nitrate, chloride, sulfate, phosphate, acetate or carbonate, and also mixtures of these salts, such as mixed nitrates/ chlorides. It is preferably a metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\prime}\right)$ nitrate. When it is desired to produce cerium based core-shell particles wherein both of the core and the shell are doped, the metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\prime}\right)$ may be the same or different from the metal $(\mathrm{M})$ described above. The metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\prime}\right)$ may be more particularly chosen from the group consisting of alkali metal elements, alkaline earth metal elements, rare earth elements, actinide elements, transition metal elements and post transition metal elements, from the Periodic Table. The definitions of these groups of elements given in connection with the metal (M) apply equally. Preferably, said at least one metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\prime}\right)$ is chosen from the group consisting of transition metal elements, such

as Zr ; post transition metal elements, such as Al ; rare earth elements, such as $\mathrm{La}, \mathrm{Pr}, \mathrm{Nd}$ and Y ; and alkaline earth metal elements, such as Sr . More preferably, said at least one metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\prime}\right)$ is chosen from the group consisting of lanthanum, praseodymium, neodymium and zirconium. Still more preferably, said at least one metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\prime}\right)$ is chosen from the group consisting of lanthanum, praseodymium and neodymium. Even more preferably, said at least one metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\prime}\right)$ is lanthanum.
[0118] According to this embodiment, the amount of salt of metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\prime}\right)$ may be determined in order to get a molar ratio $\mathrm{M}^{3} / \mathrm{M}^{3}+\mathrm{Ce}$ in the shell of the core-shell particles comprised between 0.01 and 0.15 , more particularly between 0.01 and 0.12 .
[0119] Step (b)
[0120] Step (b) consists in reacting, under oxidizing atmosphere, the aqueous dispersion comprising particles of cerium oxide optionally doped with at least one metal (M), the aqueous solution comprising a cerium (III) salt and optionally the aqueous solution comprising at least one metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\prime}\right)$ salt provided in step (a), while maintaining the temperature comprised between $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and the pH lower or equal to 11 , to produce the dispersion of cerium based core-shell particles.
[0121] The aqueous dispersion and the aqueous solution (s) can be contacted simultaneously or sequentially, in any order or any combination. When both provided, the aqueous solution comprising a cerium (III) salt and the aqueous solution comprising at least one metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\prime}\right)$ salt may especially be contacted with each other prior to step (b), so as to form an aqueous solution comprising a cerium (III) salt and at least one metal $\left(\mathrm{M}^{\prime}\right)$ salt. The resulting solution may then be contacted with the dispersion comprising the particles of cerium oxide optionally doped with at least one metal (M) in step (b).
[0122] "Oxidizing atmosphere" means an atmosphere comprising free oxygen. It can be air or any oxygencontaining atmosphere, such as a molecular oxygen enriched atmosphere for example.
[0123] The contacting step (b) may comprise a contacting substep (i) followed by an aging substep (ii). During the contacting substep (i), the dispersion and the solution(s) are brought into contact with each other while maintaining the required temperature and pH . During the aging substep (ii), the medium resulting from the contacting substep (i) is maintained at the required temperature and pH for a certain period of time.
[0124] The contacting substep (i) may be performed by introducing, preferably progressively, the solution(s) into the dispersion provided in step (a).
[0125] The molar ratio cerium oxide/cerium (III) before starting step (c) may be comprised between $1 / 1$ and $100 / 1$, in particular between $3 / 1$ and $30 / 1$, more particularly between $5 / 1$ and $15 / 1$.
[0126] The duration of the aging substep (ii) may be from 2 hours to 24 hours, particularly from 2 hours to 10 hours, more particularly from 2 hours to 5 hours.
[0127] The temperature of the medium is maintained for the duration of step (b) at a value comprised between $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$., preferably between $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$., more preferably between $15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and $45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$., in particular between $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$., more particularly between $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and $35^{\circ}$ C., even more particularly between $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. and $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

Noteworthy enough, the process can be operated at a low temperature. Energy savings can thus be achieved.
[0128] The pH of the medium is maintained for the duration of step (b) at a value lower or equal to 11 , preferably between 3 and 11 , preferably between 4 and 11 , preferably between 8 and 11 , more preferably between 8 and 10 , particularly between 8 and 9 , more particularly about 8 . Depending on the initial pH of the medium, the pH adjuster can be an acid or a base. As suitable acid, mention can be made of nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfonic acid, carbonic acid, picolinic acid, propionic acid, and mixtures thereof, being preferably nitric acid. As suitable base, mention can be made of alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides and aqueous ammonia. Secondary, tertiary or quaternary amines can also be used. Aqueous ammonia is preferred. According to a preferred embodiment, the pH adjuster is a base, preferably aqueous ammonia.
[0129] Step (b) may be advantageously carried out at atmospheric pressure (i.e. at about $1,013.25 \mathrm{mbar}$ ).
[0130] Stirring of the medium may be performed for the duration of step (b).
[0131] According to one embodiment, no salt of $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{IV})$ is introduced in step (a) or (b). In conventional cerium precipitation based methods, Cerium (IV) ions are used as crystal seeds to promote the nucleation in the solution. In the process of the invention however, cerium based particles provided from the dispersion of step (a) and intended to be the core particles already play this role. The presence of an additional $\mathrm{Ce}(\mathrm{IV})$ salt could lead to the formation of small particles of cerium oxide independent of the core-shell particles and consequently increase the dispersion index of the dispersions of particles obtained, which is not desired for the targeted polishing application.
[0132] Optional Step (c)
[0133] In step (c), the mixture obtained at the end of step (b) or step (d) detailed after may optionally be acidified. This step (c) may be performed by using a suitable acid such as nitric acid, picolinic acid, propionic acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfonic acid, carbonic acid, and mixtures thereof, preferably nitric acid. The reaction mixture may be acidified to a pH lower than 3.0 , more particularly comprised between 1.5 and 2.5 .
[0134] Optional Step (d)
[0135] In step (d), the solid material obtained at the end of step (b) or step (c) may be washed with water, preferably deionized water. When both performed, steps (c) and (d) may be performed in any order. This operation makes it possible to decrease the amount of residual anions especially nitrates in the dispersion and to obtain the targeted conductivity. This step may be carried out by filtering the solid from the medium and redispersing the solid in water. Filtration and redispersion may be performed several times if necessary.
[0136] Optional Step (e)
[0137] In step (e), the solid material obtained at the end of step (b), (c) or (d) may be subjected to a mechanical treatment to deagglomerate the core-shell particles. The step may be carried out by a double jet treatment or ultrasonic deagglomeration. This step usually leads to a sharp particle size distribution and to a reduction of the number of large agglomerated particles. According to an embodiment, the cerium based core-shell particles are subjected to the mechanical treatment of deagglomeration. According to

another embodiment, the cerium based core-shell particles are not subjected to the mechanical treatment of deagglomeration.
[0138] After step (e), the solid material may be dried in a step (f) to obtain the cerium based core-shell particles of the invention in the powder form. After step (e), water may also be added to obtain an aqueous dispersion of cerium based core-shell particles according to the invention. Other liquids than water may be used to prepare dispersions in accordance with the invention, such as a water/water-miscible solvent mixture or an organic solvent. Such dispersions may be prepared from the aqueous dispersions obtained by the process of the invention by methods known per se. The pH of the dispersion may also be adjusted at a value typically comprised between 4 and 6.
[0139] According to one embodiment, cerium based coreshell particles having a core of cerium oxide and a shell consisting of nanoparticles of La doped cerium oxide are produced. To that end, an aqueous dispersion of particles of cerium oxide, an aqueous solution comprising a cerium (III) salt being preferably cerium (III) nitrate and an aqueous solution comprising a lanthanum salt being preferably lanthanum nitrate are provided in step (a), in order to implement the above described process.
[0140] According to another embodiment, cerium oxide core-shell particles having a core of cerium oxide and a shell consisting of nanoparticles of cerium oxide are produced. To that end, an aqueous dispersion of particles of cerium oxide and an aqueous solution comprising a cerium (III) salt being preferably cerium (III) nitrate are provided in step (a), in order to implement the above described process.

[0164] the core particles are made of lanthanum doped cerium oxide and the shell particles are made of lanthanum doped cerium oxide.
[0165] Dispersion
[0166] The invention also relates to a dispersion of the cerium based core-shell particles of the invention in a liquid medium.
[0167] The zeta potential of the cerium based core-shell particles comprised in the dispersion of the invention is advantageously positive. It can be measured at a pH value of the dispersion comprised between 4 and 9.5. The zeta potential may be measured with a zetameter DT300 from Quantachrome on dispersions at $1 \%$ in weight.

[0171] Uses of the Cerium Based Core-Shell Particles or of the Dispersion
[0172] The cerium based core-shell particles of the invention or the dispersion of the invention may be used to prepare a polishing composition, more particularly a CMP composition. They are used as a component of a polishing composition, more particularly a CMP composition.
[0173] A CMP composition (or chemical-mechanical polishing composition) is a polishing composition used for the selective removal of material from the surface of a substrate. It is used in the field of integrated circuits and other electronic devices. Indeed, in the fabrication of integrated circuits and other electronic devices, multiple layers of conducting, semiconducting, and dielectric materials are deposited onto or removed from the surface of a substrate. As layers of materials are sequentially deposited onto and removed from the substrate, the uppermost surface of the substrate may become non-planar and require planarization. Planarizing a surface (or "polishing") the surface, is a
process where material is removed from the surface of the substrate to form a generally even, planar surface. Planarization is useful in removing undesired surface topography and surface defects, such as rough surfaces, agglomerated materials, crystal lattice damage, scratches, and contaminated layers or materials. Planarization also is useful in forming features on a substrate by removing excess deposited material used to fill the features and to provide an even surface for subsequent levels of metallization and processing.
[0174] The substrate that can be polished with a polishing composition or a CMP composition may be for instance a silicon dioxide-type substrates, glass, a semiconductor or a wafer.
[0175] The polishing composition or the CMP composition usually contains different ingredients other than the cerium based core-shell particles. The polishing composition may comprise one or more of the following ingredients:
[0176] abrasive particles other than the cerium-based particles (herein referred to as "additional abrasive particles"); and/or
[0177] a pH regulator; and/or
[0178] a surfactant; and/or
[0179] a rheological control agent, including viscosity enhancing agents and coagulants; and/or
[0180] an additive selected from an anionic copolymer of a carboxylic acid monomer, a sulfonated monomer, or a phosphonated monomer, and an acrylate, a polyvinylpyrrolidone, or a polyvinylalcohol (e.g., a copolymer of 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylic acid and methacrylic acid); a nonionic polymer, wherein the nonionic polymer is polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyethylene glycol; a silane, wherein the silane is an amino silane, an ureido silane, or a glycidyl silane; an N -oxide of a functionalized pyridine (e.g. picolinic acid N -oxide); a starch; a cyclodextrin (e.g., alpha-cyclodextrin or betacyclodextrin), and combinations thereof.
[0181] The pH of the polishing composition is generally comprised between 1 and 6 . Typically, the polishing composition has a pH of 3.0 or greater. Also, the pH of the polishing composition typically is 6.0 or less.
[0182] The cerium based core-shell particles of the invention may be used in the polishing compositions disclosed in the following documents: WO 2013/067696; WO 2016/ 140968; WO 2016/141259; WO 2016/141260; WO 2016/ 047725; WO 2016/006553.
[0183] The invention also relates to a method of removing a portion of a substrate, the method comprising polishing the substrate with a polishing composition prepared from a dispersion comprising the cerium based core-shell particles according to the invention.
[0184] The invention finally relates to a semiconductor comprising a substrate polished by this method.
[0185] Should the disclosure of any patents, patent applications, and publications which are incorporated herein by reference conflict with the description of the present application to the extent that it may render a term unclear, the present description shall take precedence.

## EXAMPLES

[0186] The invention will now be further described in the following examples without intending to limit it.

Example 1: Particles Core $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}(60 \mathrm{~nm})$ Shell $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}-$ Concentration $5 \mathrm{wt} \%$
[0187] A dispersion of cerium oxide particles in water at $5 \%$ in weight is prepared by adding 233 g of cerium oxide aqueous dispersion Zenus ${ }^{\circledR}$ commercially available from Solvay (average primary particle size $\sim 60 \mathrm{~nm}$ calculated from BET measurements) at $30 \%$ in weight in 1167 g of deionized water. A dilute ammonia solution is prepared by adding 42 g of $28 \%$ aqueous ammonia in 208 g of deionized water. A solution of trivalent cerium nitrate solution is prepared by adding 25.5 g of trivalent cerium nitrate solution at 2.87 M in 87.5 g of deionized water.
[0188] The cerium oxide aqueous dispersion at $5 \%$ in weight is introduced in a 2 L jacketed reactor semi closed and then stirred (agitator with four blades inclined at 300 rpm ). The reaction mixture is then warmed up to $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. under the same stirring. The initial pH of the dispersion is increased up to 9 by addition of ammonia solution at 2.5 M . Then the trivalent cerium nitrate solution is added at 5 mL per minutes by a peristaltic pump. During this step, the pH is maintained at 8 by the controlled addition of ammonia solution at 2.5 M . After the end of the addition, the reaction mixture is maintained at the same temperature and same stirring for 4 h . The pH is maintained over this time by the controlled addition of ammonia solution at 2.5 M . The reaction is then stopped and the dispersion is washed several times by centrifugation, removal of the centrifugation supernatant and redispersion of the cake in deionized water. Finally, the dispersion is adjusted at $10-15 \%$ by weight with a pH around 5 and an ionic conductivity below $0.1 \mathrm{mS} \cdot \mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The dispersion is deagglomerated by successive passes through a dual-impact jet homogenizer.
[0189] The dispersion obtained is observed by TEM. It is noted that the particles are monodispersed and size centered around 110 nm . The diameter is determined after the count of 150 particles on TEM images, whereby an average particle size of 109 nm with a standard deviation of 16 nm ( $15 \%$ of the average size) is obtained. It is observed that the cerium salt precipitated on the Zenus ${ }^{\circledR}$ cerium oxide particles, leading to a shell formation with a rough surface (FIG. 1).
[0190] Part of the dispersion is dried in an oven at $200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$., thereby obtaining a powder for the XRD analysis and the BET surface measurement. The diffractogram of this powder shows signature of crystallized $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ (record ASTM 34-394). The average crystallite size of the core-shell particles is 69 nm . The BET specific surface area determined by nitrogen adsorption is $13.0 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ for the starting particles and $18 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / \mathrm{g}$ for the core-shell particles, giving an average primary particle size of 64 nm and 46 nm respectively. The secondary particle size is measured at relative refractive index 1.7 of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ in the water by laser particle sizer (Horiba LA-910) for the starting particles and the final core-shell particles. The D10, D50 and D90 are respectively 81,99 and 123 nm for the starting particles. The D10, D50 and D90 are respectively 89,107 and 129 nm for the core-shell particles, which gives a dispersion index $\sigma / \mathrm{m}$ of 0.19 . The secondary particle size is also measured at relative refractive index 1.7 of $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ in the water by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The hydrodynamic diameter is 169 nm for the core-shell particles. The morphology of the particles before and after the formation of the shell is observed by SEM (FIGS. 3 and 4 respectively).

[0191] Example 1 is repeated with the difference that, instead of the trivalent cerium nitrate solution, a solution of trivalent cerium nitrate and lanthanum nitrate is used. It is prepared by adding 22.95 g of trivalent cerium nitrate solution at 2.87 M and 2.55 g of trivalent lanthanum nitrate solution at 2.87 M in 87.5 g of deionized water (molar ratio $\mathrm{La} / \mathrm{La} \bullet \mathrm{Ce}$ of 0.10 ).

[0220] Evaluation of the Polishing Performance
[0221] The polishing machine used is a Struers Tegramin. The surface to be polished is made of amorphous silica. The dispersions of the core-shell particles in water were tested under the following conditions:
[0222] pressure applied on the head: 50 N ;
[0223] rotation speed: 150 rpm ;
[0224] pad: neoprene (MD-Chem)-new pad for every sequence;
[0225] flow-rate of the dispersion: $15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$;
[0226] dispersion: the amount of core-shell particles is $1 \mathrm{wt} \%$;
[0227] the pH of the dispersion is comprised between 6.0 and 6.1 , obtained by addition of diluted NH4OH;
[0228] polishing time: 10 minutes.
[0229] As reference, a cerium oxide aqueous dispersion of Zenus® particles commercially available from Solvay (average $\mathrm{CeO}_{2}$ primary particles size $=60 \mathrm{~nm}$ calculated from BET measurements) at $1 \% \mathrm{wt}$ and $\mathrm{pH}=6.0$ is used.
[0230] The polishing sequence is the following:
[0231] 1) The reference dispersion is tested,
[0232] 2) The sample is tested,
[0233] 3) The sample is tested a second time.
[0234] Between each step of the sequence, the pad is cleaned with deionized water and the dispersion to be tested is introduced on the surface to be polished under the controlled flow-rate.
[0235] The loss of weight of the substrate is recorded. The removal rate (RR) expressed in $\mathrm{nm} / \mathrm{min}$ is then calculated as:

$$
R R=\sigma
$$

(7) indicates test missing or illegible when filed
[0236] wherein:
[0237] $\Delta \mathrm{m}$ is the weight loss of the substrate;
[0238] R radius of the substrate;
[0239] $\rho$ density of the substrate;
[0240] $\Delta t$ is the polishing time;
[0241] Removal rate efficiency ratio is the ratio of the mean removal rate achieved with the tested dispersion to the removal rate achieved with the reference dispersion for each sequence. As it can be seen from table 1, all the particles of the invention show an improvement of removal rate compared to the reference used (removal rate efficiency ratio above 1). The best results are obtained with doped particles (ex. 2 and 5).
[0242] At the end of the polishing test, the substrates and core-shell particles are visually inspected: it is confirmed that the nanoparticles from the shell of the core-shell particles of the invention were sufficiently anchored to remain attached to the core during the polishing.
