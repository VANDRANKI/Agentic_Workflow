CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION
[0001] This is a divisional application of and claims the priority benefit of U.S. application Ser. No. 16/805,864, filed on Mar. 2, 2020, now allowed, which claims the priority benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 62/928,312, filed on Oct. 30, 2019. The entirety of the above-mentioned patent application is hereby incorporated by reference herein and made a part of this specification.

## BACKGROUND

[0002] The semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) industry has experienced exponential growth. Technological advances in IC materials and design have produced generations of ICs where each generation has smaller and more complex circuits than the previous generation. In the course of IC evolution, functional density (i.e., the number of interconnected devices per chip area) has generally increased while geometry size (i.e., the smallest component (or line) that can be created using a fabrication process) has decreased. This scaling down process generally provides benefits by increasing production efficiency and lowering associated costs.
[0003] Such scaling down has also increased the complexity of processing and manufacturing ICs and, for these advances to be realized, similar developments in IC processing and manufacturing are needed. For example, some transition metal elements such as ruthenium ( Ru ) become important materials because their superior features of low resistance under small cross-sectional area and barrier-less adhesion ability. Although these transition metal elements provide great electrical properties, their inert characteristics such as higher hardness make them difficult to process, specifically in a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process.

[0019] In some embodiments, each of the metal gate strips includes a gate dielectric layer 110 and a gate electrode 112 (or called "replacement gate") on the gate dielectric layer 110. In some embodiments, the metal gate strips extend in a direction different from (e.g., perpendicular to) the extending direction of the fins $\mathbf{1 0 2}$. In some embodiments, each of the gate dielectric layers 110 surrounds the sidewall and bottom of the corresponding gate electrode 112 and on the top and sidewall of the corresponding fin 102, as shown in FIG. 1. In some embodiments, interfacial layers such as silicon oxide layers are formed between the fins $\mathbf{1 0 2}$ and the gate dielectric layers 110 .
[0020] In some embodiments, the gate dielectric layers 110 include a high-k material having a dielectric constant greater than about 10 .

The N-type work function metal layer may include TiAl, TiAlN, TiAlC, TaAl, TaAlC, TaAlN, TaCN, the like, or a combination thereof. In alternative embodiments, the work function metal layer is a P-type work function metal layer to provide a gate electrode that properly performs in a P-type FinFET device. The P-type work function metal layer may include TiN, WN, TaN, the like, or a combination thereof. The fill metal layer includes copper $(\mathrm{Cu})$, aluminum $(\mathrm{Al})$, tungsten $(\mathrm{W})$, or a suitable material. In some embodiments, each of the gate electrodes $\mathbf{1 1 2}$ can further include a liner layer, an interface layer, a seed layer, an adhesion layer, a barrier layer, the like, or a combination thereof.
[0022] In some embodiments, the method of forming the intermediate structure of FIG. 1 further includes partially removing the metal gate strips, the spacers 104 and the etching stop layer 108 to form T-shaped gate openings in the sacrificial dielectric layer, forming dielectric helmets 116 in the T-shaped gate openings, removing the sacrificial dielectric layer, forming metal stacks 118 between the remaining metal gate strips, and forming a zeroth dielectric layer 122 around the remaining metal gate strips.
[0023] In some embodiments, the dielectric helmets 116 include a metal oxide, a metal nitride, a nitride, a siliconcontaining material or a combination thereof. The metal oxide may include $\mathrm{ZrO}_{2}, \mathrm{HfO}_{2}, \mathrm{TiO}_{2}, \mathrm{Al}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}$ or the like. The metal nitride may include ZrN, HfN, TiN, AlN or the like. The nitride may include silicon nitride. The silicon-containing material includes polysilicon, amorphous silicon or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the dielectric helmets 116 serve as "polishing stop layers", which will be described in details below.
[0024] In some embodiments, optional shielding layers 114 are respectively formed between the gate electrodes 112 and the dielectric helmets 116 . In some embodiments, the shielding layers 114 include metal such as tungsten (W), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), titanium (Ti) or the like. The shielding layers 114 are configured to protect the gate electrodes 112 from being damaged by the subsequent processes. In some embodiments, the shielding layers 114 are referred to as "contact etching stop layers (CESL)".
[0025] In some embodiments, the sacrificial dielectric layer and a portion of the etching stop layer 108 are removed to form gaps that expose the strained layers 106.

In some embodiments, a zeroth dielectric material layer is formed on the substrate $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ filling the gaps between the gate structures $\mathbf{1 1 7}$ by a suitable technique such as spin-coating, CVD, ALD, the like, or a combination thereof. Thereafter, the zeroth dielectric material layer is planarized by a suitable technique such as CMP, until tops of the gate structures $\mathbf{1 1 7}$ are exposed. In some embodiments, the top surface of the zeroth dielectric layer 122 is substantially level with the top surfaces of the

dielectric helmets $\mathbf{1 1 6}$ of the gate structures $\mathbf{1 1 7}$. In some embodiments, the zeroth dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 2}$ serves as a "polishing stop layer", which will be described in details below.
[0027] In some embodiments, optional shielding layers 120 are respectively formed between the metal stacks 118 and the zeroth dielectric layer 122. In some embodiments, the shielding layers $\mathbf{1 2 0}$ include metal such as tungsten (W), cobalt (Co), copper $(\mathrm{Cu})$, titanium (Ti) or the like. The shielding layers $\mathbf{1 2 0}$ are configured to protect the metal stacks $\mathbf{1 1 8}$ from being damaged by the subsequent processes. In some embodiments, the shielding layers $\mathbf{1 2 0}$ are referred to as "contact etching stop layers (CESL)".
[0028] Referring to FIG. 2, a first dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 4}$ is formed over the zeroth dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 2}$. In some embodiments, the first dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 4}$ is blanket-formed on the substrate $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ and in physical contact with the dielectric helmets $\mathbf{1 1 6}$ and the zeroth dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 2}$. In some embodiments, the first dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 4}$ includes SiN , $\mathrm{SiCN}, \mathrm{SiON}, \mathrm{SiOCN}, \mathrm{SiOC}, \mathrm{SiC}$, the like, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the method of forming the first dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 4}$ includes performing a suitable technique such as spin-coating, CVD, ALD, the like, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the first dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 4}$ serves as a "polishing stop layer", which will be described in details below.
[0029] Thereafter, a second dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 6}$ is formed over the first dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 4}$. In some embodiments, the second dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 6}$ is blanket-formed on the first dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 4}$. In some embodiments, the second dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 6}$ includes nitride such as silicon nitride, oxide such as silicon oxide, phosphosilicate glass (PSG), borosilicate glass (BSG), boron-doped phosphosilicate glass (BPSG), the like, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the method of forming the second dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 6}$ includes performing a suitable technique such as spincoating, CVD, ALD, the like, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the second dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 6}$ serves as a "polishing stop layer", which will be described in details below.
[0030] In some embodiments, the second dielectric layer 126 includes a material similar to the zeroth dielectric layer 122 but different from that of the first dielectric layer 124. In some embodiments, the polishing rate of the material included in the second dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 6}$ is similar to the polishing rate of the material included in the zeroth dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 2}$ but different from the polishing rate of the material included in the first dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 4}$.
[0031] Referring to FIG. 3, the second dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 6}$, the first dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 4}$ and the zeroth dielectric layer 122 are patterned or partially removed, so as to form at least one opening $\mathbf{1 2 8}$ corresponding to one or more of the strained layers $\mathbf{1 0 6}$. In some embodiments, the opening $\mathbf{1 2 8}$ penetrates through the second dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 6}$, the first dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 4}$ and the zeroth dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 2}$ and exposes two shielding layers $\mathbf{1 2 0}$. In some embodiments, the patterning step includes forming a mask layer over the second dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 6}$, and performing an etching process (e.g., dry etching process) by using the mask layer as an etching mask. In some embodiments, the opening $\mathbf{1 2 8}$ has a main trench and multiple holes (or called "contact hole") protruding from the main trench.
[0032] Referring to FIG. 4, a metal layer $\mathbf{1 3 0}$ is formed over the substrate $\mathbf{1 0 0}$ filling in the opening $\mathbf{1 2 8}$. In some
embodiments, the metal layer $\mathbf{1 3 0}$ includes a metal material with suitable resistance and gap-fill capability. In some embodiments, the metal layer $\mathbf{1 3 0}$ includes a transition metal element with low resistance and barrier-less adhesion ability. In some embodiments, the metal layer $\mathbf{1 3 0}$ includes RuCo , $\mathrm{RuW}, \mathrm{Ru}, \mathrm{Mo}, \mathrm{Rh}$ or Ir. In some embodiments, the Ru atom content of the metal layer $\mathbf{1 3 0}$ ranges from about 10 at $\%$ to 100 at $\%$. In some embodiments, the method of forming the metal layer $\mathbf{1 3 0}$ includes performing sputtering, CVD, electrochemical plating (ECP), the like, or a combination thereof.
[0033] Referring to FIG. 5, a first polishing operation P1 is performed with a first polishing slurry composition, until the top surface of the second dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 6}$ is exposed. In some embodiments, the first polishing operation P1 is performed by using the second dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 6}$ as a polishing stop layer. In some embodiments, the first polishing operation P1 is configured to polish a Ru-based material or the like by using an oxide-based material as a polishing stop layer.
[0034] In some embodiments, the first polishing slurry composition includes about 0.1 to 10 parts by weight of a metal oxide, and about 0.1 to 10 parts by weight of an oxidizer. In some embodiments, the metal oxide serves as an abrasive and includes $\mathrm{TiO}_{2}$ in an amount of about 1 to 5 parts by weight. In some embodiments, the oxidizer serves as a polishing accelerator and includes $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{KlO}_{3}, \mathrm{KlO}_{4}$, $\mathrm{KClO}_{3}, \mathrm{KClO}_{4}$ or a combination thereof, in an amount of about 1 to 5 parts by weight.
[0035] In some embodiments, the first polishing slurry composition further includes about 0.1 to 10 parts by weight of a pH adjustor. In some embodiments, the pH adjustor includes KOH or $\mathrm{R}_{1}-\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{R}_{2}$, wherein $\mathrm{R}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{R}_{2}$ each independently represent hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted $\mathrm{C}_{1}-\mathrm{C}_{15}$ alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted $\mathrm{C}_{1}-\mathrm{C}_{15}$ alkoxyl or substituted or unsubstituted $\mathrm{C}_{6}-\mathrm{C}_{30}$ aryl, in an amount of about 1 to 5 parts by weight. In some embodiments, the pH value of the first polishing slurry composition is from about 7 to 12 .
[0036] In some embodiments, the first polishing slurry composition further includes about 0 to 5 parts by weight of a pH buffer, and about 0 to 10 parts by weight of a surfactant. In some embodiments, the pH buffer includes organic acid, such as citric acid, acetic acid, in an amount of about 1 to 3 parts by weight. In some embodiments, the surfactant includes organic acid (e.g., citric acid, acetic acid) or alcohol (e.g., ethanol), in an amount of about 1 to 3 parts by weight. In some embodiments, the pH buffer and the surfactant are optional, and can be omitted as needed.
[0037] Referring to FIG. 6, a second polishing operation P2 is performed with a second polishing slurry composition, until the top surface of the first dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 4}$ is exposed. In some embodiments, the second polishing operation P2 is performed by using the first dielectric layer $\mathbf{1 2 4}$ as a polishing stop layer. In some embodiments, the second polishing operation P2 is configured to polish a Ru-based material or the like by using a nitride-based material as a polishing stop layer. In some embodiments, the oxide-based material is simultaneously removed during the second polishing operation P2.
[0038] In some embodiments, the second polishing slurry composition includes about 0.1 to 10 parts by weight of a metal oxide, and about 0.1 to 10 parts by weight of a chelator. In some embodiments, the metal oxide serves as an

abrasive and includes cerium oxide $\left(\mathrm{CeO}_{2}\right)$, cerium hydroxide, cerium nitride, cerium fluoride or cerium sulfide, in an amount of about 1 to 5 parts by weight. In some embodiments, the chelator serves as a polishing accelerator and includes a thiol compound or a thiolether compound in an amount of about 1 to 5 parts by weight.
[0039] In some embodiments, an oxidant is not present in the second polishing slurry composition. Rather, the chelator including a thiol compound or a thiolether compound is used instead. In some embodiments, due to the chemical inertness and high Mohs hardness of a transition metal (e.g. Ru), the polishing operation becomes difficult. However, most of the oxidizing agents cannot apply to such ceria-type slurry, because these oxidizing agents would cause ceria abrasive particles to agglomerate. The lone pairs of thiolether groups of the chelator donate the electrons to form coordinate covalent bonds with empty orbits of Ru. Such covalent bonds, unlike metallic bonds, are directional. Strong bond energy will induce electrons to redistribute and cluster at the $\mathrm{S}-\mathrm{Ru}$ side, so that $\mathrm{Ru}-\mathrm{Ru}$ bonds along the $\sigma$ bond axis would be weakened (so-called "trans effect"). Specifically, after the thiolether groups of the chelator form coordinate covalent bonds with Ru , the thiolether-Ru complex layer around the top surface becomes easier to be removed due to the trans-effect. Since the Ru atoms around the top surface lose bonding strength with under-layer atoms, the Ru surface is able to be removed by abrasive abrasion.
[0040] In some embodiments, the chelator is represented by a formula of $\mathrm{R}_{1}-\mathrm{S}-\mathrm{R}_{2}$, wherein $\mathrm{R}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{R}_{2}$ each independently represent hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted $\mathrm{C}_{1}-\mathrm{C}_{15}$ alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted $\mathrm{C}_{1}-\mathrm{C}_{15}$ alkoxyl or substituted or unsubstituted $\mathrm{C}_{6}-\mathrm{C}_{30}$ aryl. In some embodiments, an alkyl group is a stronger electron pusher toward the central sulfur atom than hydrogen. Therefore, the central sulfur atom becomes more electron rich when the side group is an alkyl group rather than a hydrogen. Such sulfur atom has higher tendency to donate its electrons and forms a coordinate covalent bond with empty orbits of Ru, and thus, the removal rate (RR) of the CMP process is accordingly improved.
[0041] In some embodiments, the second polishing slurry composition further includes about 0.1 to 10 parts by weight of a pH adjustor. In some embodiments, the pH adjustor includes KOH or $\mathrm{R}_{1}-\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{R}_{2}$, wherein $\mathrm{R}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{R}_{2}$ each independently represent hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted $\mathrm{C}_{1}-\mathrm{C}_{15}$ alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted $\mathrm{C}_{1}-\mathrm{C}_{15}$ alkoxyl or substituted or unsubstituted $\mathrm{C}_{6}-\mathrm{C}_{30}$ aryl, in an amount of about 1 to 5 parts by weight. In some embodiments, the pH value of the second polishing slurry composition is from about 7 to 12 .
[0042] In some embodiments, the second polishing slurry composition further includes about 0 to 5 parts by weight of a pH buffer, and about 0 to 10 parts by weight of a surfactant. In some embodiments, the pH buffer includes organic acid, such as citric acid, acetic acid, in an amount of about 1 to 3 parts by weight. In some embodiments, the surfactant includes organic acid (e.g., citric acid, acetic acid) or alcohol (e.g., ethanol), in an amount of about 1 to 3 parts by weight. In some embodiments, the pH buffer and the surfactant are optional, and can be omitted as needed.
[0043] Referring to FIG. 7, a third polishing operation P3 is performed with a third polishing slurry composition, until the top surfaces of the dielectric helmets 116 of the gate structures 117 are exposed. In some embodiments, the third
polishing operation P3 is performed by using the dielectric helmets 116 and the zeroth dielectric layer 122 as polishing stop layers. In some embodiments, the third polishing operation P3 is configured to polish a Ru-based material or the like by using a mixed layer of nitride-based and oxide-based materials as a polishing stop layer. In some embodiments, the nitride-based material (or carbon-based material) is simultaneously removed during the third polishing operation P3.
